    Police are investigating a report of an attempted kidnapping in Maraval on Sunday.
    
    The attack happened at about 8 p.m. on Saddle Road.
    
    Police were told that a couple, along with their five-year-old son, were in their vehicle proceeding towards Santa Cruz, when a white Hyundai Elantra overtook the car and came to a stop in front of their vehicle.
    
    Three men exited the Elantra and approached the other car and attempted to open the family’s car.
    
    However, at the same time, another vehicle approached, and the three men ran back to the Elantra, and drove off.
    
    It appeared to be a random attack.

    CENTRAL Bank Governor Dr Alvin Hi¬laire's claim that hosting Venezuelan migrants could cost the Trinidad and Tobago Government some $620 million per year has been described as "unfortunate" by Finance Minister, Colm Imbert.

    Imbert said Wednesday that he was uncertain as to how the Central Bank arrived at this figure, presenting statistics instead from the Imigration Deparrtment that he said shows much lowers numbers of migrants for 2019, and for previous years than appears to have been assumed.
    
    Speaking at the Post-Cabinet media briefing at the Diplomatic Centre in St Ann's, Imbert said inaccurate figures are running through the system, showing much larger numbers than is the reality. He said he found the CBTT's figures "surprising" and questioned the basis and information on which that institution's calculations were made.
    
    The acting Prime Minister said it was being circulated as fact that 40,000 Venezuelans had entered T&T in 2019, when Immigration has informed him that the number is actually 4,842 such persons arriving this year through legal ports, of which 4,340 departed, leaving 502 "overstayers".
    
    Having presented previous figures provided by Immigration, Imbert said the figure was lower than 2018's and several factors must be taken into account, such as that many of the Venezuelan nationals living in Trinidad for the past several years have mostly been working.
    
    Hi¬laire said on Tuesday that he was at first skep¬ti¬cal of the fig¬ure but it seemed plausible af¬ter look¬ing at the im¬pact of Venezuelan migration on on Colom¬bia.
    
    Colom¬bia has so far tak¬en in al¬most 1.2 mil¬lion Venezue¬lan mi¬grants and refugees, which has cost that coun¬try around 0.4 per cent of its GDP.
    
    Imbert said the countrys' situations with regard to the Venezuelan issue ought not to be compared.

    People with disabilities have to be physically lifted to the courts in Tunapuna because of a non functioning elevator.

The Express recently visited the Tunapuna Administrative Complex which houses the Tunapuna Magistrate’s Court, Probation Services, Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts, District Revenue Office, TTPOST, Town & Country Planning Division and the Elections and Boundaries Commission.

Elderly people have to struggle to climb the stairs to the second floor to conduct business such as getting an identification card.

The elevator has been not working for almost a year. A plant was placed in front of it on the ground floor accompanied by a hand written sign.

The Express raised the issue with Tunapuna MP Esmond Forde who said the Permanent Secretary (PS) at the Ministry of Works and Transport informed him that parts were ordered for the elevator and there was an electrical issue with another.

“The Ministry of Works have been assigned the duty to see about the repairs because the building falls under the Ministry of Public Administration and the judiciary also has a role to play because the court is the main facility there,” he said.

The MP said no time frame was given as to when there will be a functioning elevator but the permanent secretary assured she will ‘follow up’.

Would it be fixed this year?

“I would think so,” said Forde.

The Express shared the photograph of the plant in front of the elevator with Forde. He said it was ‘embarassing’ and requested from the PS that proper signage be put into place.

He said physically the building sits in Tunapuna but for electoral purposes it falls under the boundary of St Augustine.

“But I don’t look at the job so, once somebody bring something to my attention I look at it,” he said.

The National Insurance Property Development Company Limited (NIPDEC) which falls under the Works Ministry stated on its website that there was refurbishment of the Tunapuna Administrative Complex which included the upgrade of the Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing Systems, installation of the following systems – Public Address, Private Branch Exchange at the Judiciary, Closed Circuit Television System, Access Control System.

The refurbishment works also included extensive upgrades to the roof, ceilings, façade upgrades, installation of high security fencing, upgrades to fountains and all common areas.

The project was completed in October 2015 and despite all these works the elevator remains out of order while the differently abled and elderly left at a disadvantage.

Rodrigo Abd
SAN MIGUEL LOS LOTES, Guatemala (AP) — They call it the Volcano of Fire, one of the most active volcanoes in the Americas, frequently spewing ash and gas across a swath of Guatemala west of the capital. On June 3, the mountain erupted with a fury not seen in more than a century, exploding with 1,300-degree molten rocks and black clouds of ash that smothered villages and buried at least 194 people alive. An additional 234 are missing.

Rodrigo Abd was among the Associated Press photojournalists who arrived on the scene. As he covered the news, he considered how to capture the sweep of the volcano's destructive power and the magnitude of the human drama that unfolded in minutes. How to document the tragedy — of lives and a landscape obliterated — on a piece of 35mm film?

Abd decided that the panoramic format was necessary to tell this story of annihilation. Black and white film would best show ash-encased villages such as San Miguel Los Lotes.

Peering through his lens, and through clouds of hot ash, he found Elmer Vazquez searching for his wife and five children where he thought the family home had been. The farmer looked destroyed as he climbed into pits dug by a backhoe whenever he saw human remains or bits of torn clothing that could have belonged to his family.

In a makeshift morgue, dozens of victims' bodies wrapped in white bags formed a kind of silent corridor that ended with two exhausted forensic doctors taking a break after days and nights of continuous work.

Outside the morgue, anxious relatives waited for the results of DNA tests to see if their loved ones were among those inside, while others prepared to hold dignified burials in the town cemetery.

In San Miguel Los Lotes, the drama did not end in those first days. Ten days after the volcano blew, Angelica Maria Alvarez continued looking for her husband, two daughters and more than nine relatives in a house turned to twisted iron and hot ash.

Six months after what is now being called "The Colossus," relatives still seek missing family members by their own means, as the government and relief agencies have ended their search for the dead.

The political and economic crisis in Venezuela tops the agenda of President Donald Trump's meeting Friday with leaders from the Caribbean, a region that has been far from united in joining the U.S. call for the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump is hosting the leaders of Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, Dominican Republic and St. Lucia at his affluent Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, to show his support for Caribbean countries that back democratic transition in Venezuela. The five have either denounced Maduro or have joined more than 50 countries in recognizing Juan Guaido as the rightful interim leader of the nation.

The Trump administration considers Maduro's government a dictatorship and says he was re-elected in an illegitimate election. The U.S. has sanctioned scores of top Venezuelan officials and has blocked U.S. banks from doing business with Venezuela, putting a financial strangle-hold on the cash-strapped country. The country is in an economic meltdown and millions of Venezuelans have fled.

"As games games President Trump clearly stated, the toughest sanctions are yet to come," national security adviser John Bolton said in a tweet Thursday. "Unless Maduro's usurpation ends, he and his cronies will be strangled financially. The window is closing."

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says Trump will use the meeting to thank the leaders for their support for peace and democracy in Venezuela and discuss potential opportunities for energy investment.

Nations in the Caribbean, however, have been split on whether to interfere in Venezuela.

For years, Venezuela has provided a reliable supply of oil to many Caribbean nations. They purchased the oil under the PetroCaribe arrangement, which gave them low-interest credit terms, but have left them indebted to Caracas.

Sanders said Trump will also use the meeting to strengthen cooperation and counter "China's predatory economic practices." Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump administration officials have told countries that they should beware of Chinese investment opportunities.

It's unclear how well Trump's message will be received. The U.S. has a long history of interventions — military and otherwise — in Latin America. And Trump has not always been kind to impoverished nations like some in the region. Last year, while meeting with senators on immigration, Trump questioned why the United States would accept more immigrants from Haiti and "s---hole countries" in Africa, according to one participant and people briefed on the conversation.

    JAFAR HOWE, the 19-year-old Laventille whose acceptance into the prestigious Princeton University and subsequent sponsorship by an anonymous businessman has gone viral, hopes his story would help change the stigma of the area which is considered by many, a crime hotspot.

Howe, in an interview with Newsday on Saturday, said there were several success stories like his coming out of Laventille, where people who are now doctors, lawyers and politicians started from humble beginnings.

“I got this publicity for my story and I am glad for it, but there are many other professionals from Laventille who started off just like me, but went under the radar.”

A resident of Quarry Street, Howe will be studying engineering and public policy. He told Newsday, since his acceptance to Princeton, a private Ivy League research university in New Jersey, USA, became publicised, he has been getting calls from several people congratulating him and calling him an inspiration. He has also gotten calls from several people in Laventille, who not only wanted to congratulate him but encourage him to continue striving for excellence because they were in the same position as him.

“People are calling and messaging me and saying they grew up just down the road from me, and they knew what it was like growing up, and they are lawyers and doctors now.”

Howe told Newsday even as a young man, passing for St Mary’s College (CIC), he had to battle the stigma that was attached to his village.

“It was hard because when some students found out that I was from Laventille, they had already put an idea in their minds of what to expect from me. Some of the students would even make jokes about it, but I never let it affect me. The teachers did not treat me any differently, but it made me realise that I had to change the perception of Laventille in their minds. So I beat them – in test.”

Howe said after a few times proving himself academically, students began changing their view of him and of Laventille.

Howe, the eldest of three children, said changing the perception of Laventille was not his only challenge as he pursued his dream of going to Princeton. He said collecting funds for tuition, room and board was also a great challenge because he did not want to burden his parents with the massive bill that came with being accepted into a foreign university the likes of Princeton. Howe said he began making money tutoring other students and even sold popcorn at his old school to add to the savings and scholarships he and his family already had.

“Tuition for Princeton is actually USD$74,000 a year, including room and board. I couldn’t afford that even if it was in TT. I knew from the time I began applying that the scholarships would not be enough. I didn’t want to take money out of my parents’ pockets and hinder my younger siblings. I needed to make money to help myself.”

Howe and family tried several fund-raisers and also opened a GoFundMe page seeking donations and pledges to cover the bill. That was where Howe got his big break as an anonymous businessman pledged USD$20,000 which would help him cover all his expenses. Howe said with the problem of financing out of the way, he would not have to worry about finding a job to make ends meet. He could focus on his books.

“When we saw that, because we all saw it at once, my grandmother screamed out ‘Oh gosh!’ and hugged me. Family began congratulating me and messaging me. They kept telling me ‘Congratulations you are going to Princeton.’ It actually hasn’t fully hit me yet that I actually got what I needed to go.”

Howe expressed pride that his story became a symbol of hope for TT amid the deluge of bad news that comes across the media. He said if TT wanted to find more people like him, they should look to Laventille.

“I am glad to be that symbol that people needed in this time. I am proud to be that positive symbol in the media. But I am not the only one striving for these goals and achieving academically, I am just one of the few who were publicised. We have good sportsmen and sportswomen. We have professionals that come out of Laventille and I just want that to get into the minds of as much people as possible.”

     AMELIA RAJACK has returned from her second Carifta games , held on the Easter weekend in the Cayman Islands, with six medals. Competing in the 11-12 age group she won two gold, in the 200m butterfly and 4x50m freestyle relay; a silver in 200m freestyle; and two bronze medals, in the 100m freestyle, the 400m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay events.

It was a huge improvement on her first “Carifta” when, having to concentrate on the SEA examinations, she had qualified only for a relay event. She actually swam in one individual event, the 200m butterfly, but only because that was the only race that had room for an extra Trinidad and Tobago competitor.

In her first Carifta outing, young Rajack won two relay medals and was ninth in the 200m butterfly. However, because one of the finalists was unable to compete, she swam the 200m butterfly final where she ended up sixth of eight swimmers.

    A first-time Caribbean study, coming out of the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) and The University of the West Indies (UWI), has claimed that seafood harvested from heavily-industrialised areas of Trinidad’s west coast presents “a high cancer risk to the human population”.

Conducted by Aaron Balgobin and Natasha Ramroop Singh, of UTT and UWI, respectively, the report has suggested “remedial action” to lower risks to the population from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in marine life in western coastal areas, particularly the environs of Port of Spain and Pointe-a-Pierre.

The study further warns of increased risks in these areas during the wet season and, while suggesting that the data contained could inform policy makers, also suggested that “remedial action is needed in this area, such as controlling PAH emissions from their sources”.

Balgobin and Ramroop Singh’s peer-reviewed work, “Source apportionment and seasonal cancer risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of sediments in a multi-use coastal environment containing a Ramsar wetland, for a Caribbean island”, was also published in the international journal, Science of the Total Environment. The document notes that “this is the first such study analysing the carcinogenic risks from coastal sediment to the population of a Caribbean island”.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies 16 PAHs as priority pollutants due to potentially toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. PAHs are a group of more than 100 chemicals also called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are released from burning coal, oil, gasoline, trash, tobacco, and wood. Local environmentalists, including Fishermen and Friends of the Sea (FFOS), have for several years claimed that PAHs and other hazards related to the petrochemical industry have caused fish kills in the Gulf of Paria and along the south-western coast.

This was disputed by Government, which said independent tests showed local seafood to be safe.

Seasonal risks

According to the UTT/UWI report, “The mean Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCR) due to fish consumption from this region during the dry and wet seasons was N1 × 10−4, indicating a high cancer risk to the human population.”

Balgobin and Ramroop Singh further stated: “In addition, there is a high cancer risk to the general population via sea-food ingestion from this area during the dry and wet seasons... The wet season cancer risk was generally higher than the risk for the dry season. Near-shore sediment posed a greater cancer risk than offshore sediment due to the higher concentration of PAHs from terrestrial sources.”

The researchers used a “dietary ingestion model” to assess human cancer risk using sedimentary PAHs.

The study noted that areas examined were of interest “due to the presence of industrial, urban and shipping activities situated alongside a protected wetland site on the west coast of Trinidad”, referring to the Caroni Swamp, an internationally-protected Ramsar site.

It notes the presence of petrochemical plants at Point Lisas, which utilise natural gas as a feedstock for ammonia, urea, melamine and methanol production, along with iron and steel plants.

“All these activities predominate on the west coast of Trinidad, where therein lies the Caroni wetland (a protected wetland) in close proximity to the capital city of Port of Spain and a natural oil seep site at La Brea, which is the largest deposit of asphalt in the world,” the study noted.

Multiple PAHs source

It was found that gasoline and diesel fuel combustion are the major sources of PAHs found in sediment.

The report further asserts that local seafood ingestion exposes 14 per cent of the population to adverse health risks annually and that “the population is exposed to high cancer risk from fish consumption”.


PAHs were quantified in sediments during the dry and wet seasons and were observed to be significantly higher in the wet season compared to the dry season, Balgobin and Ramroop Singh found.

“Also emerging from this study is that PAH levels were lower in the areas where natural gas is the dominant energy source for industries, compared with those areas where crude oil-based fossil fuel is predominantly used,” the study stated.

“It was observed that near-shore sediment PAHs concentrations were higher than offshore levels.”

The sources of PAHs, identified by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) in the marine sediments, were “vehicular combustion of gasoline and diesel, biomass burning, industrial combustion and oil spills”, the report said. The researchers have suggested that the results “can be utilised for developing an effective environmental management policy for coastal areas in Trinidad and the wider Caribbean region, given that much of the islands’ populations depend on the coastal regions for seafood”.

“In addition, these results may assist in boosting current efforts of policymakers, towards phasing out crude oil-based fossil fuels for cleaner energy sources, such as compressed natural gas,” they stated.

Contacted yesterday, FFOS secretary Gary Aboud said the study’s claims have come as no surprise, as the organisation continues to witness fish kills on Trinidad’s west coast, which it believes to be a result of consistent petro-chemical pollution.

“We would want to call on the leader of the nation, Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley, to declare an environmental state of emergency in the Gulf of Paria,” Aboud said.

“What is happening in the Gulf is cause for immediate, unrelenting remedial action and we urge the Prime Minister to, for now, turn away from the notion of development in traditional terms of highways and buildings, and invest in the health of the environment and therefore the health of the people of this country.”

WARNING ON WHISTLEBLOWERS: Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar addresses guests at the UNC Women’s Arm Mother’s Day gala dinner held at Passage to Asia Restaurant, Chaguanas, on Saturday night. -Photo: ISHMAEL SALANDY


OPPOSITION Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar says her “former and present colleagues” Anand Ramlogan and Gerald Ramdeen are “good lawyers”.

She told United National Congress (UNC) supporters on Saturday night she knew members of the party would have troubled hearts right now.

Persad-Bissessar deliberately did not name Ramlogan and Ramdeen, who are scheduled to appear before the courts this morning on conspiracy-related charges, but described the attorneys as former and present colleagues. She also drew a parallel between the two lawyers and corruption charges laid against seven UNC members before the 2002 parliamentary elections.

Speaking at the UNC Women’s Arm Mother’s Day gala dinner, at Passage to Asia Restaurant, St Yves Street, Chaguanas, she said: “I know your hearts are troubled at the moment because of certain matters taking place elsewhere. Let justice take its course. Let not your hearts be troubled. Let justice take its course with respect to former colleagues of ours, present colleagues. I don’t want to name them tonight. I don’t want to prejudice any matters that are before the court, but we know those two lawyers are very good lawyers, so let justice take its course in the courts of law of Trinidad and Tobago.”

Hinting the two unnamed lawyers were connected to her, the UNC political party, and its campaign for office in 2020, she added: “I have already said it. I find the timing of these things very suspicious, and I’m reminded that every time an election is in the air, the same thing happens. Seven UNC members were charged just before the 2002 election. You all remember that? Basdeo Panday, Finbar Gangar, Tim Gopeesingh, you name them, and what has become of those cases? Nothing, absolutely nothing.

“So I want you to clear your brain. Let us stay focused on the real enemy. Let us stay focused on the ills that face our society. Let us stay focused and band together to work together. People have no water in this country (for) two months, three months. That is an important issue. People are losing their jobs. Let us stay focused on that, and that is why I have said, when we get back into office with your help, we will create over 50,000 jobs. You know, they’re asking, ‘Hey, so how are you going to do that?’ You know how we’ll do it? We did it once and we can do it again. We have a track record.”

‘Afraid of this Govt’

Earlier in her speech, referring to the ruling People’s National Movement (PNM), she said: “They have come over the last four years with the most draconian pieces of law, and then they say we are obstructionists, but when your member of Parliament stands up in that Parliament, or your senator stands up, we are not doing it for ourselves. They say we are afraid. Well, now I am really afraid of this government, of their draconian intention. I am really afraid. All along I said I’m not afraid, but you know what, I’m afraid for you. I’m afraid for our children in this country, and that is why I give you the commitment, they could say what they want, they could say we are obstructionists, they could do what they want, we will stand for you in the Parliament and outside of the Parliament.

“We will ensure that good law is passed to protect your rights, so there’s a piece of law that’s going to come back on Monday (today)...we did the Wednesday part of it. It’s called the Whistleblower Bill, and in that whistleblower-proposed law, they are saying that everybody who employs people (has) to set up a whistleblower-person in (their) business(es).”

She added: “So, everybody, whether you’re hiring a driver, a housekeeper, whatever it is, or if you’re a big business with many people, you have to put a whistleblower, and you have to pay them. How can that be right? How can that ever be? So you have to appoint somebody, and what about this bill now reminds me of Nazi Germany because it’s everybody must carry news on everybody else. You understand what’s happening?”

An Express fact-check of the draft Whistleblower Protection Bill could not confirm Persad-Bissessar’s claims.

Two senior police officers were kicked and cuffed by residents as they attempted to arrest a suspect in the chopping of three members of a Santa Flora family on Sunday.

Inspector Khan and Sergeant Smith responded to reports of a wounding near the Palo Seco velodrome at around 8am.

But the officers were ambushed by an unruly crowd.

Police said officers suffered injuries about the body and were taken to the Siparia Health Facility.

The 40-year-old Guapo man was detained into police custody.

Initial reports stated that the man entered a Santa Flora home and severely chopped three members of the family.

Leslie Forrester, 57, his wife, Jennifer Alexander, 55, and daughter 30-year-old Lisanne Forrester were chopped multiple times about the body.

Police said the man walked into the house and began chopping Lisanne Forrester in the head and neck.

Her parents intervened and were also attacked.

Leslie Forrester was chopped in the back and left hand. His hand was severed at the wrist, police said.

Alexander suffered wounds to the head, back and arms.

The three were taken to the Siparia Health Facility and later transferred to the San Fernando General Hospital for further treatment.

Police said Lisanne Forrester was listed in critical condition. Her parents were in stable condition.

Investigators are yet to determine a motive for the chopping.

Carnival energy took over the streets of Atlanta, Georgia recently, as Caribbean immigrants and descendants assembled in the southern state to celebrate the festival on Memorial weekend. Trinbagonian DJ extraordinaire, “International Stephen” Phillip and his DSM team staged a grand schedule of six events entitled the Atlanta Carnival Experience (ACE).

On Memorial Day, the ACE crew teamed up with the Secret Soca Society from New York to host a “RED J’ouvert” experience with paint and powder, intermittent rain showers, soca music and fun galore. Patrons came out in their numbers to enjoy the authentic Trinbagonian Jouvert experience and stayed the course in spite of intermittent showers.

A debate between two groups of stakeholders regarding the question of noise pollution in our communities raises once again the question of co-operation and collaboration among persons with competing interests. The promotions group known as Red Ants took serious issue with the authorities, in this case the Environmental Management Authority, who with the assistance of police officers, ordered the lowering of decibel levels during a Carnival fete at the Queen's Park Oval on Saturday night. Complaining that the orders to turn down the volume could have jeopardised their event, and worse still, action such as this could “kill the Carnival”, the promoter has called for a review of the existing laws regarding noise pollution. On the other hand, one resident, speaking on behalf of those she described as “the young, the old, the sick, and not to mention the dogs”, spoke about persons having to put up with excessive noise, and the “wildness of promoters”, some of whom she said feel they own the laws of this land. “They complained like babies about having to follow the laws of the land,” she remarked. For one thing, though, it took years of sensitisation, activism and prodding on the part of a few persons with insight into the ill-effects on health and well-being of excessive noise, to bring enough sensitivity on this issue to the table, before those in authority felt compelled to begin to establish the environment for restraint. Among them was the late Rhona Ince, whose campaign centred for years around those events being held at the very Queen's Park Oval and the then King George V Park across the street in St Clair, known now as Nelson Mandela Park. Interestingly though, our own report on the event in yesterday's edition made no mention of any diminution of excitement or revelry, as a result of the orders to lower the tempo, so to speak. In fact, patrons were portrayed as having a good time, regardless, with the headline act Machel Montano in full command. The very fact that the event was not cut short demonstrated that the lowering of the decibel levels was not the disaster as the promoters may have sought to portray it. Also to be noted is the fact that in increasing instances, fete goers themselves complain about the noise levels coming at them on the inside. What the issue points out is the need for greater understanding by promoters that it can no longer be a free for all, that fetes and parties can continue to take place with no regard for the rights of others, whether on town or in country, the enjoyment of their own spaces, without the unnecessary and unwanted intrusions of others, whether by excessive noise or other violations. Encouragingly, the promoters themselves have demonstrated the presence of mind to accept the need for further dialogue, towards the arrival at common ground with affected stakeholders. This is the spirit in which, as the Red Ants crew themselves have noted, artistes, deejays and promoters must continue to meet with the authorities and other interested parties, in order to build stronger platforms going forward, for the mutual benefit and comfort of all concerned.

A POLICE officer remained in critical condition at hospital after she was doused with a flammable liquid and then set on fire during a domestic dispute yesterday morning.

Her boyfriend, a 33-year-old member of the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard, was arrested shortly after and was in police custody up to last night assisting officers with their investigations.

The incident took place around 4 a.m. at the woman’s Boundary Road, El Socorro, home.

Investigators said the officer, 29-year-old Kelly Ann Humphrey, and the man had a verbal argument which soon became physical when the man doused her with the liquid and set her ablaze before fleeing the scene.

The officer, who was attached to Police Administration Guard Unit, screamed out for help and was assisted by neighbours who came to her aid and later transported her to Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex at Mount Hope.

As detectives were at the scene conducting enquiries, the suspect returned to the location and was immediately detained and taken to San Juan Police Station for questioning.

He is currently facing a charge of attempted murder, said police.

THE Inter-American Development Bank has confirmed what everyone but the wilfully blind already knows. Given the billions and billions of dollars that have passed through this country, thanks to the natural resources with which our land is blessed, we should be enjoying a much higher quality of life with a lot more to show for it.

As reported in yesterday’s Sunday Express, an IDB study titled “Building Opportunities for Growth in a Challenging World” ranked Trinidad and Tobago second to last among Latin American and Caribbean countries in the perception of infrastructure quality against per capita income. Special mention was made about poor roads, limited ports, ageing water distribution infrastructure and limited sanitation network, and energy inefficiencies.

As shocking as it is for T&T to be ranked so lowly, the IDB study only scratches the surface of the lived reality for hundreds of thousands of people in this country. While the transport problem for urban Trinidad is largely about traffic jams, in parts of rural Trinidad communities endure a complete absence of roads or roads reduced to rubble, isolation due to untended landslides and collapsed bridges and a lack of public transport which forces the most vulnerable to pay the highest prices for getting in and out of their areas. The country’s proud boast of a 95 per cent supply of pipe-borne water rings hollow to the growing number of people who not only have no water in their pipes but have no reliable alternative truck-borne supply.

Over 30 years ago, the late Jamaican prime minister Michael Manley captured this country’s wasteful deployment of its income with the pithy observation that the petro boom was passing through Trinidad and Tobago “like a dose of salts”. In the years since then, successive governments still have not figured out how to transform higher income into a higher standard of living. What governments more quickly master is the art of profligacy, higher consumption and waste during periods of plenty and non-strategic belt-tightening when the cycle switches to lean. Focusing on the productivity value of every dollar spent is never a priority for governments invariably focused on winning the next general election within a five-year horizon that is inherently at odds with the development agenda and its medium to long-term vision.

No government appears to believe that it has the capacity to disrupt the prevailing political culture and survive - which explains why transformational planning enjoys no position of power at the table of decision-making.

This development dilemma underscores the imperative of local government reform to give communities real power over resources and decisions. Such reform could completely alter the power dynamic between central government and local government if it redistributes power to community—which is a challenge not to be taken lightly.

Given the powerful potential of meaningful local government reform, it is no surprise that it remains the pledge of every political party seeking votes yet implemented by none once in government. Yet, bringing people into the decision-making process might be the best way to ensure that national income is spent equitably, productively and in improving the quality of life for all.

THE catastrophic collapse of part of the Manzanilla-Mayaro Road on Sunday as a result of flood waters that carved a new watercourse was inevitable, and if rain were to continue to fall regularly, there would be more damage.

And until it can be repaired, thousands of people headed east from Mayaro will have to commute through Rio Claro.

Director of the Highways Division in the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, Roger Ganesh, said the roads damage was the worst he had seen in his 34 years as an engineer.

He said it could cost more than $5 million to build a temporary road, and more than $50 million for a permanent replacement. Part of the road was still under water yesterday, but more than 300 metres of the surface has been swept away.

The road has been closed until further notice.

Ganesh, who visited the devastated area yesterday, said nothing could be done to fix the road until all water was completely drained.

The Manzanilla-Mayaro Road runs between Manzanilla and Mayaro, between the Nariva Swamp and the coastline. The area has suffered devastating floods before, with residents recalling a similar wash-out in the 1970s.

It is like a lake inside here, Ganesh said yesterday,

He intends visiting the area again today to assess damage.

He said, From what I saw this morning the damage there, it is quite extensive. We have at least 300 metres of roadway completely gone.

Ganesh told the Express, The whole lagoon became filled to capacity and started spilling over on the roadway to find its way. The water cuts across the road to get to the sea. The whole system overloaded with the amount of rain falling and that caused the erosion which caused the road to fail. I wouldnt say because of surges of undermining. It was just the nature of the water to flow into the seas that caused the road to wash away completely.

He added, The amount of rain that fell and the velocity force of the water coming out of the lagoon caused the wash-offs. It was not because of poor work.

Ganesh said the ministry will be able to say by this weekend exactly what was the extent of damage and what would be the approximate cost to fix it.

Also by weekend, a plan will be in place to construct a temporary connectivity road, where the damage is now situated, he said.

Traffic diverted to Cunapo

The permanent structure which may cost at least $50 million will take at least three months to complete and should not fail if there was another excessive rainfall, he said. The temporary road should be built within a three-week-period and may cost about $5 million, Ganesh said.

Works on both roads will begin simultaneously, he said.

Usually, the Manzanilla-Mayaro Road would be used by heavy trucks and equipment belonging to oil companies that operate out of Mayaro and Guayaguayare.

Ganesh said he did not want those vehicles using other roads too often, because they will cause more damage and traffic congestion.

In the interim, traffic will be diverted to the Cunapo Southern Main Road that begins in Sangre Grande and the Naparima/Mayaro Road.

A CONCOCTION of sexual enhancement pills, alcohol and energy drinks that was consumed by a 52-year-old man before embarking on a sex romp with a prostitute is believed to have been the cause of his death, at a guest house in Chase Village on Friday night.

After they heard the woman scream out, security guards at the establishment sprang into action and kicked in the door leading to the room where she and the man had been having “vicious sex”, police said.

At first, the guards believed the woman was being raped or being forced to perform other acts against her will but when they entered the room, they found the Diego Martin mechanic nude and unresponsive on the bed.

Investigators said they were informed by others who were present at the time that, during the course of the night, the man, whose identity was not revealed, had been drinking puncheon rum, beer, stout and energy drinks, all while surveying the numerous women at the club.

Sometime later, he made his selection of “a darkie” before consuming a number of pills. He then paid a sum of cash to the woman, after which they then proceeded to a room in the upstairs portion of the building, according to police.

But not long after they entered the room, the security guards heard the woman’s screams.

She was interviewed by officers, during which she informed them that she and the man had been having “vicious sex”.

However, the woman said she found it strange that, while on top of her, the man suddenly stopped moving, trapping her beneath.

At first, she assumed that he had passed out due to his drunken state, but later realised he was not breathing. It was at this point she called out for help.

Central Division police were contacted and arrived at the scene shortly after.

Business operations at the establishment were also brought to a stop for the rest of the night as the officers carried out their enquiries.

The man was later pronounced dead by a district medical officer and his body removed.

An autopsy is expected to be performed at the Forensic Science Centre in St James today to determine the exact cause of death.
