    CREAM OF THE CROP: Trinidad and Tobago cyclists, from left, Keron Bramble, Kwesi Browne, Njisane Phillip and Nicholas Paul, during a training session at the Anna Meares Velodrome in Brisbane, Australia, last week. Phillip, Paul and Browne will be back at the venue this morning (T&T time), competing in the men’s team sprint qualifying round.

“Continued improvement” is the goal set by Trinidad and Tobago Cycling Federation (TTCF) technical director and national coach Erin Hartwell for the four wheelmen who will wear national colours at the 2018 Commonwealth Games here in Brisbane, Australia. And from all indications, Njisane Phillip, Nicholas Paul, Kwesi Browne and Keron Bramble are on course to achieve the target.

“The guys are firing,” Hartwell told the Express. “They’re doing personal bests in training. I’m very happy with the preparation so far. We have a strong group of young men and we’re as ready as we’re going to be.”

    Trinbago SocaRacer took a commanding lead at the second leg of the 2018 Caribbean Motor Racing Championship (CMRC) at the Frankie Boodram Wallerfield International Racing Circuit last weekend.

Leading the charge for the local team were Aqeeb Ali, Marc Gill and Ronald Wortman. Ali won all three races in the GP 1 category to be crowned champion, with Gill taking champion honour in the GP2 category, also winning all three races, while Wortman was crowned GP 3 champion.

Preliminary results show host Trinidad and Tobago holding a huge lead having amassed 928 points, with Barbados in second position on 273, and Guyana with 248 holding third. Jamaica is a distant fourth on 73 points.

The two-day event showcased the best drivers and cars from the English speaking Caribbean, and one of the outstanding performances came in the Radical Cup Races where 16-year-old Issa Deen won the feature race to be crown champion in that category.

    Guyana will host five matches, one more than they did last year, when the  2018 Hero Caribbean Premier League (CPL) bowls off next month.

These matches will be hosted at the Guyana National Stadium, Providence, home of the Guyana Amazon Warriors (GAW).

The first game scheduled for August 9 features a clash between host GAW and the St Kitts & Nevis Patriots, led by Chris Gayle. Warriors will then have two more home matches,against the St Lucia Stars and Barbados Tridents, before leaving for a series of away fixtures and then returning home for two massive matches against current champions, Trinbago Knight Riders, and last year’s fourth place finishers, Jamaica Tallawahs. This split means that Guyana Amazon Warriors fans can look forward to two home legs this year. 

Speaking about Guyana's increase in matches from last season Hero CPL’s chief executive officer, Damien O’Donohoe said: “We are delighted to confirm that there will be five home games for the Amazon Warriors in 2018. The Hero CPL has always had fantastic support from the Guyanese people and the Government. We can’t wait to see sellout crowds once again.” 

And Guyana and West Indies young and upcoming player, Keemo Paul, who will be representing Amazon Warriors had this to say: "I can't wait to get going for the 2018 Hero CPL and I know that the Guyanese cricket loving public will show us great support. Having five home matches at Providence will be a huge boost for us this year as we know home conditions well. A sell-out crowd will only help us as we look to bring the Hero CPL title to Guyana."

This year's tournament will feature defending champions Trinbago Knight Riders, Barbados Tridents, Guyana Amazon Warriors, St. Kitts & Nevis Patriots, St. Lucia Stars and Jamaica Tallawahs.

    A security blanket is expected to be placed around an important whistleblower in the person of Queen’s Counsel Vincent Nelson, whose disclosures play a significant part of the corruption case against former attorney general Anand Ramlogan and United National Congress (UNC) Senator Gerald Ramdeen.

Nelson, a member of the legal profession in the UK, is expected to appear in court today, having agreed to turn State witness. The Express understands that Nelson has been granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation and a plea agreement is expected to be arrived at.

Nelson, who is of Jamaican descent, had been retained for a number of cases by the previous administration during Ramlogan’s tenure as attorney general. He was paid millions of dollars since he was given the brief for nine proceedings, including the Petrotrin/Malcolm Jones matter, cases involving UTT, UDeCOTT, Las Alturas, Eteck, Clico, Ministry of Finance and the Board of Inland Revenue. All the payments came from the Office of the Attorney General, and not from the individual State companies.

During the People’s Partnership term of office, the Office of the Attorney General spent a total $1.4 billion in legal fees. However, sources said some of the $1.4 billion went back to a certain official through a “tax” system in which a number of lawyers were instructed to pay back part of their legal fees to that official.

Three-year probe 

Ramlogan was arrested by detectives of the Anti-Corruption Investigative Bureau (ACIB) yesterday at 4.15 a.m. as he was about to board a flight to the British Virgin Islands via Miami to appear in the case of Mark Vanderpool versus Julien Wilcox.

Ramdeen surrendered to ACIB detectives three hours after Ramlogan’s arrest.

The three-year investigation, which commenced under former commissioner of police Stephen Williams, encountered several hurdles, due to jurisdiction matters.

The Express understands that Queen’s Counsel Edward Jenkins has been retained by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to prosecute the matter.

Jenkins has been in and out of Trinidad during the course of the investigation and guiding a select team from the ACIB in how to pursue the investigation, which included three foreign jurisdictions.

Efforts to get Nelson to change his testimony occurred twice, both times by a junior attorney who reportedly flew abroad on two occasions seeking an audience with Nelson. Efforts to obtain a comment from the junior attorney yesterday were unsuccessful.

How Petrotrin probe started- The A Team 

A five-member team comprising Queen’s Counsel Alan Newman, British forensic accountant Martin Hall, Guyanese commercial attorney Akbar Ali and local attorneys Gerald Ramdeen and Mark Seepersad were introduced to the populace at a media briefing held on August 13, 2010, at the Office of the Attorney General.

Ramlogan, the man behind the appointments, had the blessings of then-prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar and government members to commence the probes.

Their mandate was to uncover corruption with the aim of securing both criminal and civil proceedings against former State board members who served under the then-Patrick Manning administration.

Three months later, following the formation of the team, Seepersad left without receiving any payment, stating the work he conducted was public service.

The team had been commissioned by Ramlogan to investigate the operations of several State agencies, including the University of T&T (UTT), Petrotrin, The Sport Company of T&T (SporTT), T&TEC, the Evolving Technologies and Enterprise Development Co Ltd (eTeck) and the Scarborough hospital. There was also an audit into the water taxi Su.

The alleged criminal wrongdoing uncovered was supposed to have been passed onto the police for further investigation.

Within a year into the probes, Ramlogan changed his tune, saying the probes would only concentrate on civil proceedings.

Checks with the police, as well as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, revealed that no matter concerning UTT, eTeck, Petrotrin, sporTT, MV Su, or T&TEC is being criminally probed.

Ramlogan said on August 13, 2010: “No price is too heavy for this country to pay to unravel the corruption and mismanagement that took place under the PNM to ensure that it never happens again and to ensure that the public sense of outrage and sense of justice is one that is satisfied, provided there is a case to answer. I attach no ceiling to this matter.”

On September 16, 2010, at the opening of the 2010-2011 Law Term at the Hall of Justice, Ramlogan responded to criticisms by then-opposition leader Dr Keith Rowley who spoke out against Ramlogan’s decision to hire “his friends” to conduct the audit, saying: “I don’t know if Dr Rowley expects me to hire my enemies? What am I to do, hire people who are not my friends? I have a lot of friends in the legal profession and I tend to rely on them for independent, impartial, reliable and competent legal advice and I make no apologies for that.”

    The Africa World Documentary Film Festival (AWFF) will be screened in Trinidad for the first time in it's decade old history. The AWFF 2016 TNT festival is being hosted by The Caribbean Travelling Film School and the UWI Film Program. The AWFF is dedicated to films from or about Africa and African diaspora or films from producers or directors from the same locales. Pretty much films from everywhere. The 28 films being screened have been selected from 24 different countries so there is a very wide selection in terms of origin as well as genre. Most people may think of documentaries as boring talking heads type of films, but nothing can be further from the truth. Modern documentaries run the gamut from serious drama to light comedy. They only have one thing in common. They are real stories about real people or events, but they are told in all the varying ways that modern narrative films have encompassed. Directors such as Michael Moore, who made many popular documentaries such as Bowling for Columbine, Sicko and of course Fahrenheit 9/11, have made the genre into a mainstream format, so much so that there are documentary categories at the Oscars, in recognition of the quality of these films. The AWFF is actually a travelling film festival and it is screened in the USA, the Caribbean, Africa and the UK, so it's quite fitting that it is being hosted by the Caribbean Travelling Film School. In addition, the curator of the festival, Dr. 'Niyi Coker Jr., is a lecturer at the film school and has taught the directing workshops both in Barbados and in Trinidad. Professor Coker is the E. Desmond Lee Distinguished Professor of Theatre and Media Studies at the University of Missouri, Saint Louis. He has directed over fifty major stage productions around the world. His narrative feature “Pennies for the Boatman”, won Best Screenplay at the 2012 Madrid International Film Festival and was a finalist for Best Director and Best Film. His latest documentary film “Ota Benga: Human at the Zoo” has already won the award for Best Scientific & Educational film as well as the Best Director of a Documentary award at the prestigious. London International Film Festival The Caribbean Travelling Film School is the English Caribbean's first and only institution dedicated entirely and only to teaching film fundamentals. It was established seven years ago by three Caribbean film makers as a way to train prospective crew members in the different islands, to help jump start the fledgling film industry in the Caribbean. Through workshop programs in Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, the school has brought film making to the masses and trained dozens of potential film producers in the art and science of film production. The school's headquarters and studio are at 23 Gordon St, in Port of Spain in the middle of the district that houses the major learning institutions in Port of Spain. St Mary's College, Bishop Anstey's, St Joseph Convent, COSTATT and UTT NAPA are all within two blocks of the film school. This year's edition of the festival is being screened at both the film school's studio and at the much more spacious screening facility of the UWI Film Program. The festival starts on Wednesday 16th March and runs through Saturday 19th March with three screenings at 2 pm, 5 pm and 8 pm daily. The screenings are repeated at the UWI venue at the same times on the following days, starting on Thursday 17th March. All screenings are free and as they say, open to the public. The 8 pm screening on Wednesday 16th at the film school will be preceded by a cocktail launch and is by invitation only. The festival is sponsored by the lead sponsor HADCO and its brands Obikwa Wines of South Africa and Emborg and by the Cocoa Pod Chocolate Shop and Alternative and Biologic Solutions, distributor of Mosquito Dunks.

    THE gun allegedly found in the home of one of the men accused of murdering Chaguanas businesswoman Vindra Naipaul-Coolman was the one used in carrying out her kidnapping in December 2006, according to forensic tests.This was revealed yesterday at the Hall of Justice in Port of Spain as the trial recommenced before Justice Malcolm Holdip in the Second Criminal Court after three weeks of no evidence being heard.Over the last three weeks, no evidence was presented to jurors as Justice Holdip entertained and considered submissions made by the State and defence team of attorneys on a particular issue raised by the prosecution.Upon its resumption, jurors were read statements of former Special Anti-Crime Unit of Trinidad and Tobago (SAUTT) officer Cpl Matthew Maers, in which they heard that after the gun was found in the house belonging to Keida Garcia, at Upper La Puerta, Diego Martin, on January 6, 2007, it was taken for forensic testing.The gun was fired twice, with those shells being compared to the ones found at the home of Naipaul-Coolman following her kidnapping, with there being a match which concluded the weapon was the one used to carry out the kidnapping.Maers, a British national, also wrote in his statements of how he saw small red spots on the floor of the house but tests carried out on those spots concluded it was drops of paint.In the house, the officer said he also found and seized a jigsaw, two Motorola cellphones and marijuana seeds among other items. He further stated that he at one time accompanied other officers to the small red-brick house in which Naipaul-Coolman was allegedly killed and found a pool table.However, forensic examinations carried out on those items did not provide anything of evidential value. Maers is one of the States final witnesses before it closes its case against the 12 men accused of murdering Naipaul-Coolman. There are just about four more witnesses to testify before it does so in the trial which has been ongoing since March 24 last year. The prosecution has called close to 70 witnesses so far.It is contending that the Chaguanas businesswoman was kept in the red-brick house for several days following her kidnapping from her Lange Park home, before she was shot once to the chest while sitting on a pool table after which her body was dismembered with an electric saw and disposed of at an unknown location.The trial is expected to resume tomorrow.

    REAL estate and used car dealer Sheron Sukhdeo was shot and killed on Monday night.
    Police are confirming that Sukhdeo was shot multiple times in a drive by attack outside the home of relatives at Caroni Savannah Road, Charlieville shortly before 9p.m.
    Sheron
    Killed: Sheron Sukhdeo
    Sukhdeo, who is married and the father of two, died while being treated at hospital, police confirmed.
    In September 2017, Sukhdeo was freed in the Chaguanas Magistrate court on the charge of breaching a protection order taken out by his wife Rachael.
    In February 2016, he was charged with assaulting his cosmetologist wife, a charge that was later dismissed after the woman told the court she no wanted to pursue the case.
    At the time of his death, Sukhdeo was on $200,000 bail on the charge of receiving two stolen vehicles.
    On his Instagram and Facebook accounts, Sukhdeo would often post photographs posing with his luxury vehicles and sports cars, wearing gold jewellery. One of his more recent photographs was with a small aircraft that he said he had purchased.
    Sukodeo was shot at around 8.30pm at the Mahabir Street home of his in-laws.
    He was taken to the Chaguanas District Health Centre where he died.

    Schoolboy Jesse Beephan was murdered.
    In a telephone interview with the Express last night, Jesse's father, Shakar Beephan, said his family was traumatised over their loss.
    “Whoever he was with, they hit him about two lashes on his head with a piece of iron. The police have the weapon. They told me about it. I cannot express how I feel. I am just waiting on the police to do their investigation. I don't want to make any accu­sations at anyone,” he said.
    The father said the initial information that his son was seen getting into a silver-coloured car was false.
    “My son does not travel anywhere, go in any taxi. So that was not true that he was getting into a car at St Mary's (junction). On Monday, she (Beephan's mother) went to pick him up and waited by the school for some time, then she started to look for him.

    It's that time of year again, and the shopping plazas over the past weekend told the story. I took notice as parents with children in hand and in tow, went from shop to shop buying school supplies. For me, the scenes were instructive.
    First, it demonstrates that education is still important to Jamaicans. As hard as life is for the majority of Jamaicans, I have noticed that most parents make every effort to send their children to school even those labelled as "bad parents".
    My own organisation, Hear The Children's Cry, can attest to that fact. Weeks ago, parents began asking for assistance with their children's book lists. Some of the parents who called me simply wanted help with portions of the lists, pointing out that they could find the rest of the money. That type of interest and action is not indicative of bad parents.
    Our parents by and large understand how important it is for their children to have the required books for school, even when some of them, like my own mother, didn't know or understand the contents of the books. As a little girl, I was always intrigued and sometimes amused that my mother would shout, "Betty, go tek up you book," without any knowledge of what was written inside them. My mother, who was semi-literate, epitomised that status and station, as well as the aspirations of many parents in her generation they weren't educated, but they understood the value of education and they wanted their children to have a better life than they had.
    That sentiment has not changed, despite the significant shifts in the socio-economic and cultural life of the country. The parents of today still want to see their children achieve a better life than theirs, and the buoyancy of the "back to school" activities is a testament to that fact.
    I'm told that one of the biggest sellers in the wholesale markets and on the streets is spray starch, and the school uniforms tell the tale. Monday morning "back to school" is a sight to behold new shoes, perfectly starched and pleated skirts and crisp khaki uniforms adorn the educational landscape new book bags laden with books, and children bustling and hustling to school, filled with the innate hope and optimism characteristic of childhood.
    Many of the parents I have worked with, as well as my mother, would tell me constantly that they wished they had had certain educational opportunities as children. My mother was the eldest of 12 children and because of her mother's untimely death was forced to drop out of school to care for her siblings. As my mother grew older she would reflect on her childhood deficits, and though she became a self-taught adult, the opportunities she lost in primary and secondary education were difficult to recover. That is the story of many parents in Jamaica, and the baseline for parenting intervention strategies.
    What Jamaican families need is an enabling environment in which their children and themselves can gain economic independence and the self-esteem and self-respect that comes with it. Employment is a key factor. Parents who are employed feel better about themselves and by extension their children. Employed parents are better able to "employ" good parenting practices. My own motto is: "Employ Parents Empower Families".
    But while the entire national focus over the next few weeks will be centred on the back-to-school environment, attention must also be placed on the thousands of young people who are not going back to school. Chief among them are those who left high school without any type of certification.
    Over the last few weeks there has been a widespread hue and cry about this year's poor CSEC results, especially in English language, and clearly the situation is cause for concern.
    But as poor as the CSEC results were, it is not the worst story. Even more alarming is the large number of children, perhaps as many as 20,000, who were not able to sit the CSEC exams because they did not meet the required standard. It is that cohort, by and large, which helps sustain the inter-generational cycle of poverty and dependency.
    Add to those numbers the large percentage of high school and tertiary graduates who, even with certification and higher educational qualifications, are unable to find employment or opportunities, or both, for furthering their education. We live in a society in which financial institutions provide loans for virtually all the material things available even, dispensing loans, I'm told, to cover season tickets for certain social events, but provide little or nothing for people wanting to educate themselves.

    Sometimes you just want to go down the road to the Savannah and watch some real sport for a change.
    It may be nothing more than a few fellas refusing to accept the inevitable consequences of advancing years, huffing and puffing their way through a Sunday morning football sweat. Or some athletic young men, putting aside their preoccupation with babes, bling and gang warfare (not necessarily in that order) and channelling all that pent-up energy and anger on the makeshift basketball court.
    Whatever it is, these anonymous occasions of loosely organised athletic activity seem to be much closer to the fundamental essence of sport than some of the global mega-events that preoccupy the attention of hundreds of millions of fans around the planet whose list of priorities is topped by the need to ensure that the cable TV bill is paid promptly and that a fraction of the monthly budget is set aside for the must-see pay-per-view events that crop up every now and then.
    More and more, we're seeing that the competition is not in the event itself, but the duel of television executives and broadcasting companies to reinvent, rebrand and aggressively market variations from the traditional fare, or at least present the old stuff as something different, just to ensure that the target audience, which has so many options to choose from, stays interested.
    You look at a lot of international football and wonder what all the fuss is about. Mediocrity and boring predictability, even with enhanced crowd sound effects and an excitable commentator, is still mediocrity and boring predictability. Former national player Carlton Franco, back home for the launch of the Veteran Footballers Foundation two Sundays ago, wasn't as harsh as that but essentially said the same thing when comparing the systems and regimented structure of the modern game with the improvisation (critics will say disorganisation) and intuitive thinking that was demanded in the days when he played in front of the Grandstand.
    Pete Sampras, still the holder of the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 14, was last week lamenting the growing one-dimensional nature of men's tennis with the vast majority of players on the professional circuit Roger Federer is the one notable exception preferring to stay on the baseline and exchange booming groundstrokes and passing shots with their opponents, thanks in no small measure to advanced technology that gives the modern exponent more power of shot than even the champions of previous eras ever managed off their racquet strings.
    In the face of such repetitiveness, somebody with enough influence always comes up with a bright made-for-TV idea, like last year's three-match series between Federer and Sampras or the one-off event that pitted Federer against Rafael Nadal, with one side of the court being carpet and the other clay. And let us not forget that Sir Allen Stanford's "20/20 for Twenty" is just another manifestation of the attempt to cash in on the rising tide of popularity in this newest and shortest form of international cricket to the extent that it threatens the viability, if not the existence, of the traditional variety.
    Such gimmickry and artificiality fly in the face of what a sporting contest should really be about, but as long as there are enough people prepared to pay enough money for such glorified non-events, they will continue to prosper.
    Which is why Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao met in the ring in Las Vegas on Saturday night for a non-title event that was typical of the stage-managed sideshow that professional boxing has become.
    This latest so-called "Superfight" ended after the eighth round with the 29-year-old Filipino, generally regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter today, dominating the American from start to premature finish. De la Hoya, stopped for only the second time in his 16-year professional career, hardly mustered a serious challenge and later conceded that he didn't have what it takes anymore, physically, to be competitive with the very best in the business.

    Yet his lack of energy would be no surprise to those familiar with the challenges of a heavier fighter losing a considerable amount of weight to make the 147lb welterweight category, a division that de la Hoya hadn't fought at for seven years. Indeed, it was speculated that, in the time between the weigh-in the previous day and the opening bell on Saturday night, de la Hoya would have been back up almost to 160lbs, all of which would have taken a serious toll on his effectiveness when it really mattered in the ring.
    On the other hand, Pacquiao had to move up two weight classes to compete as a welterweight, a task the medical experts say would not have been as challenging and physically taxing as the weight-loss that de la Hoya had to undergo to meet the requirements of the fight.
    So why go through all of that for a manufactured contest in which there was no title at stake We all know what the answer is of course: money. Pacquiao earned US$11 million, his biggest purse ever. But hear this. Despite enduring the beating of his life, de la Hoya is expected to collect almost twice that amount by the time the revenue from the pay-per-view audience is assessed.
    Not even the old saying about the victor taking home the spoils holds true anymore in this upside-down, wheeling-and-dealing world of contemporary professional sport.
    At least there's always the Savannah.

    “GIVE we back we money!”
    That was the demand to concert promoter Glenroy Watson from food vendors authorised to do business at last Sunday’s I Am Legend–The Return concert held at the Queen’s Park Savannah, Port of Spain.
    One vendor, who asked to not be identified, said all 21 vendors who rented food booths from Watson’s High Frequency Entertainment (HFE) for the Buju Banton-headlined show suffered an average of $15,000 to $20,000 each in losses.
    Watson refused to comment on the matter when contacted by the Express yesterday.
    The vendors said they paid fees of $8,000, $7,000 and $4,000 to rent booths of various sizes at the venue on concert day.
    They said they were given assurances by HFE agent Michaelon “Mikee” Solomon of Print City that over 25,000 general admission tickets had been sold for the showcase.
    They claim they were also told that the show would run from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m.
    However, three vendors who spoke to the Express yesterday said they estimated the crowd to be less than half that.

    They said the show ended at midnight. As a result they were left with thousands of dollars worth of cooked and prepared food at the end of the night.
    “Give we back we rental money. I paid a rental fee of $4,000 for a booth and didn’t even cover that rental in sales. I invested $20,000 in stock that I cannot recoup. This is the case with most if not all of the vendors.
    “We estimated 12,000–15,000 people at the show, not the 25,000 promised. And 5,000 of that number was in VIP and had no access to our booths,” the irate food vendor who trades under the brand Instirell Caterers told the Express via phone yesterday.
    Jean Campbell of Carter JBT International caterers said she paid a $4,000 rental fee to secure a booth at the venue.
    “I lost about $18,000 to $20,000. When you put food in a glass case you can’t reuse that. All the perishables— the vegetables and the rice and all the meat that would have been prepped and cooked. You can’t really use that again. I had to give it away and use it feed the homeless on Tamarind Square,” she said.

    MOVING TO ONE BEAT: Entertainer Ella Andall, second from left, followed by costumed dancers, enters the Regency Ballroom, at the Hyatt Regency on Wednesday night during rehearsals for the Brian MacFarlane-designed opening ceremony of the Fifth Summit of the Americas. 
    This nation takes centre stage globally this evening when the opening ceremony of the Fifth Summit of the Americas takes place at the Hyatt Regency from 5p.m. Newsfeeds the world over will broadcast the official arrival of the leaders of nations here to discuss ways through which we can weather the storms ahead, while continuing to develop and accomplish the unified greatness the Americas aspire towards.
    Enjoying prime coverage during the opening ceremony will be the culture of Trinidad and Tobago through a presentation conceptualised by masman Brian Mac- Farlane who was commissioned by the Government to produce a series of cultural presentations as well as create the Summit Village and a number of sculptures and effigies erected at specific locations.
    MacFarlane told the Express the cultural presentation is 45 minutes long and will trace the development of the Caribbean peoples from the indigenous inhabitants to the multiethnic citizenry of the region today.
    MacFarlane said the music and dance being presented will reflect all the ethnicities and cultures of the region all interwoven into a continuous flow that will exhibit the oneness of the region in the midst of its diversity.
    "The 45-minute production will explore the many journeys of the Caribbean peoples from the Caribs and Arawaks, through the arrival of the Europeans, the coming of the African slaves and the Indian and Chinese indentured."
    "The show will also visit the camboulay and other aspects of our cultural diversity while also addressing modern-day issues such as the environment and the state of our energy sector, oil and gas as well as natural and human resources."

    "This all runs as a continuous show with all the music having been composed and chosen specifically for it. This will climax with a grand Carnival finale. Initially we had incorporated several artistes from across the Caribbean to be a part of the presentation, but budget cuts forced us to cancel much of these. The show will still be a grand affair we can all as a nation be proud of though," MacFarlane said.
    The production will feature hundreds of dancers, singers and musicians from across the country including Tobago. Several dance troupes including the Marcia Charles Dance Company, Carol La Chapelle Dancers, Malick Folk Performers and Shiv Shakti Dancers have combined efforts for the production.
    Machel Montano who is these days working on his music in Los Angeles has taken time off to come in for the show as well as David Rudder who was scheduled to arrive from Canada yesterday. Veteran soca artiste Arrow from Montserrat has also been invited to be a part of the ceremony and local soca artiste, Tony Prescott is performing "All Aboard" at a special point during the ceremony.
    MacFarlane said that reggae music is also incorporated in the presentation and Stephen Marley, son of Bob Marley, had been invited to perform, but he had to cancel at the last minute due to scheduling conflicts. The opening will also feature the National Steel Symphony as well as the Divine Echoes Orchestra and the Laventille Rhythm Section.

    KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug 23, CMC – More than 200 workers have been placed on the unemployment line after a leading distiller, blender, and bottler of rum announced it was closing down two of its operations on Wednesday.
    J. Wray & Nephew Limited, a subsidiary of the Campari Group, a major player in the global branded beverage industry, said it had taken the decision because of the ongoing economic losses occasioned by the combined effect of escalating operational costs and the declining cost of sugar.
    “This doesn’t in any way, shape, or form signal any exiting from sugar. We’re simply dealing with this area, which is least productive, most costly, most challenging and difficult for us when we did a broad-scale analysis to make that change to cauterise the losses. That, simply, is it,” the company’s chairman Clement ‘Jimmy’ Lawrence told The Gleaner newspaper here.
    He told the newspaper that the company remained committed to the sugar cane industry as evidenced by its recent multimillion-dollar upgrade of the Joy Spence Appleton Estate Rum Experience in St Elizabeth, southwest of here.
    At least 226 workers have been placed on the breadline as a result of the decision and Lawrence told the Gleaner “we had a very good meeting with the staff and the union. It went very well.
    “We outlined all of the support we are giving to our employees, and I think it was very well received. We really went out there to make sure that we treat our people well because they have really done our bidding in terms of programmes, the activities, and changes that we made to try to improve on our efficiency and operations. It was the very least that we could do, and we are very pleased that it was well received.”
    “We were forced into this situation simply because of the difficulties there,” he said, adding that the Holland estate which was closed Wednesday, is below sea level.
    “You have to pump water off the land. It takes electricity to operate those huge Farbus pumps, and so you can see right at the outset, it’s challenging. And even areas that we have to irrigate, you don’t irrigate with the same level of cost as it is to pump water off the land. So that really is the fundamental story surrounding our actions,” he added.
    Lawrence said that the issue was compounded by the global situation with sugar, with Jamaica suffering a major setback with the loss of a guaranteed sugar quota to the European Union last October.
    “The production of sugar cane has declined, and global purchasers have been able to

    Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis announcing the government’s offer to acquire hotel. Image via Cana News, 23 August 2018. 
    NASSAU, Bahamas, Aug 23, CMC – the Bahamas government says it has made a deposit of US$10 million in a bid to acquire a hotel and save an estimated 400 jobs.
    Prime Minister Dr. Hubert Minnis said while the government has no desire to run the Grand Lucayan resort, it nonetheless intends to keep to its promise to ensure that the facility returns to its glory days of employment.
    “I have just recently made a deposit for the purchase of this hotel. We have signed the sales agreement and we hope to complete the purchase of this hotel within the next 30 days,” Minnis said after touring the facility with over 4,000 luxury villas.
    He said the full details of the sale would be outlined when the Parliament resumes next month.
    “It is not our intention to run a hotel. The government cannot run a hotel. But it is our intention to save the jobs of the (400) Grand Bahamians who work in this hotel,” he said.
    The decision to buy the property came after Canadian real estate developer Paul Wynn, who had signed a letter of intent with the Hutchison Whampoa to buy the resort, pulled out of the sale.
    Wynn said that he thought the final purchase price negotiated, of US$65 million, was too high. He said it could take between US$110 million and US$120 million to fully open the Grand Lucayan.

    International Tourism Consultant Sandra Allum is dead set on doing everything possible in an attempt to change the attitude of people towards keeping the environment positive.
    Last year, in early August, she organised an environmental exhibition on San Fernando Hill with the theme "Recycling: With a little effort we can make a big difference". Several companies dealing with environment protection supported the event, some using display booths like Carib Glassworks, Piranha International and Nigel Khan Bookstore.
    This year, Allum has been involved with the mobile exhibition launched at the Savannah Terrace of the Hilton Trinidad and Conference Centre on Sunday October 3 themed "The Environment is You".
    The aim of this year's event is to sustain the effort initiated last year where the target group was schoolchildren. The exhibition is a concerted effort by a group of concerned citizens determined to make the management of the environment a priority and includes top Carnival bandleader Brian McFarlane with additional support coming from bpTT, Piranha International and Green Cyclone Inc.
    The theme encapsulates a continuing intent to sensitise not only children but every citizen to caring for the environment. While corporations and government play a critical role, everyone can contribute to 'keeping a clean scene' through little efforts that can make a large difference every day.
    Giving a few examples which cause environmental damage and their consequences, Allum listed the following: *The seemingly small action of throwing a cigarette butt through the window of a moving car can result in huge losses via a tragic fire. *Surface vegetation loss causes extensive erosion and during heavy rains assists voluminous unchecked flows of water into low lying areas creating havoc with life and property. *The reckless and irresponsible dumping of waste into our waterways has left many families without homes, children struggling to get to school and crops totally decimated and where no insurance coverage for this type of risk is available.
    So not only lives, but livelihoods are affected in so many ways. Most importantly many of our hard working citizens are stripped of their dignity as the most affected must seek assistance from friends, strangers and the State.
    This year's project seeks to inform, educate and sensitise the wider public to small conscious actions that can have a strong and sustainable impact on securing the health of our environment, for our present and future generations.
    While last year the group focused primarily on youth, this year the efforts embrace the wider public, encouraging small changes in behaviour that could impact the environment in very significant ways.
    The travelling exhibition comprises graphic photos which juxtapose irresponsible behaviour with the images of the pristine beauty. Such beauty we can achieve if only minds and destructive attitudes are altered.
    The concept of the travelling exhibition is the first of its kind, in that it will be moved from location to location taking its message throughout Trinidad and Tobago. The exhibit will be placed at Better Value at Gulf View Link Road, San Fernando this weekend.

    Earlier this month Exxon announced that it had made a major new oil find off Guyana. It was, Exxon said, the largest since it began exploration there in 2015. The company's statement followed one last June advising of a “world-class discovery” on another well, and before that, announcements about four other commercially exploitable finds.
    What this and Exxon's recent request to the Guyanese government for permission to drill up to 40 new wells after 2022 suggests, is that the country is about to become a major oil producer in the Western Hemisphere.  Although various groups within Guyana have expressed concern about aspects of the country's first revenue-related petroleum agreement with Exxon, and there are uncertainties about the extent to which Guyana will see downstream investments, the finds are expected to have a transformational effect when oil begins to flow in 2020.

    A MORUGA man turned into a human fireball when he was set on fire at a lime at a village bar on Easter Monday.
    Raymond “Abba” La Fortune was doused with puncheon rum and set on fire at the bar in Moruga.
    He suffered second degree burns to his upper body and remained in intensive care at hospital yesterday.
    La Fortune, 55, lives at Rock River, Moruga.
    He was liming at a bar at Penal Rock Road, Basseterre Village, when he got into an altercation with a group of men around 2.30 p.m.
    Police were told one of the assailants flung a bottle of rum at La Fortune and another man threw a cigarette lighter at him. La Fortune’s clothes caught on fire and he ran out of bar, screaming.
    Witnesses contacted the police and ambulance services, and helped La Fortune extinguish the flames.
    Paramedics took La Fortune to the Princes Town District Health Facility, and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of the San Fernando General Hospital.
    Officers of the Moruga Police Station are investigating and up to yesterday no one had been arrested.

    “It’s a real tragedy. It’s part of the larger political situation because it is producing tragedies for human lives. It is beyond the humanitarian issue and it is at the stage of putting ordinary people at risk who are in search of survival.”
    So said former foreign affairs minister Winston Dookeran on the tragedy at sea in which 25 people are feared drowned while trying to reach Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night. Nine people were initially rescued and 25 remained unaccounted for on Thursday night.
    Dookeran also commended ­new­ly installed moderator of the Presby­terian Church Rev Joy Abdul-­Mohan for considering opening the church’s schools and places of worship to Venezuelan migrants and refugees. Abdul-Mohan has also said their sister churches in Canada and the US have opened their doors to ­refugees.
    Asked to share his sentiments on the tragedy, Dookeran said: “It touches your conscience when people are in search of survival. Your heart goes out to the people who have lost their lives. The incident has to be seen in its historical context. There has always been migration of people in the world, and they have lost their lives fleeing untenable conditions. It happens in many parts of the world, and this is close to home so we are more ­affected and impacted.
    “Such a situation is quite intolerable. It is heartbreaking. It adds to the urgent need to find some solutions. It should be resolved in stages. There should be a coming together on the issues of migration. Now I think Trinidad and Tobago might wish to take an initiative in stages to ­prevent things like that from happening again.
    “It also tells us about the need for urgency. It should be not just seen as news... as just a sea tragedy, but as heart-wrenching incidents that stir us into finding another solution and ­another way of looking at things.”
    Dookeran also said: “East Indian immigration happened about 150 years ago, and in contemporary times, we should not see it as a ­natural course. It will continue. There should be a step-by-step solution. It is about engaging all the parties, including the (Nicolas) Maduro regime and the Opposition (Juan Guaido). The United Nations Secretary General (Antonio Guterres) has a moral legitimacy to initiate diplomatic action on matters of such tragic loss of lives whether it in this area or any other area. It is a life and death issue. It is no longer a human rights issue.”

    Keeping watch: Armed police officers patrol near apartments on Nelson Street, Port of Spain, after rival gangs engaged in a shoot-out on Thursday night. 
    AS rival gang members exchanged gunshots in East Port of Spain between Thursday night and yesterday morning, residents were trapped and unable to leave their homes.
    The Express yesterday visited the area, following clashes between members of the Muslim City gang and members of Rasta City.
    Police, with help from Regiment soldiers, entered the area and arrested 25 people on Thursday night.
    They were all released later Thursday night and yesterday.
    Residents also hurled accusations, claiming police officers arrested members of only one gang to weaken it so that the other gang could move in on their turf.
    The Police Service did not issue a statement on the incident.
    But Commissioner of Police Gary Griffith spoke to TV6 News and said: “I don’t see that being practical.
    “The individuals (Rasta City) tried to take control of the turf but it was (the same police) who removed those individuals, so it is impossible to ­fathom, because when the other gang tried to take control of that area, it is the same police who removed the gang from the area,” he said.
    But he noted: “If one gang is weakened as the Muslims were (Thursday), it is quite possible that the opposing gang may take advantage.” He said he was not buying into any claim by a resident that his officers were influenced or paid to ­arrest one gang, adding the police were against all gangs and were not taking sides in any turf war.

    Police said none of Singuineau’s relative have turned up to identify his body being kept at the Forensic Science Centre.
    And the family of his battered wife, Chinel Jeffrey, want nothing to do with him.
    Singuineau was fatally shot by police who were contacted by neighbours who heard the woman’s screams at the couple’s apartment at Enterprise Street.
    Chinel was chopped multiple times her head, neck, back, and hands, during the attack.

    Officers of the Central Police Division responded and after Singuineau refused police orders to surrender, he was shot and killed.
    Jeffrey, a mother of four, was taken to the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mt Hope where she was warded.
    She underwent emergency surgery on Saturday and has been heavily sedated since.
    She has not been able to give a statement to police, and officers still do not know what triggered the brutal attack.

    DIRECTOR of the Medical Research Foundation (MRF) Prof Courtenay Bartholomew has said that the HIV/AIDS programme in Trinidad and Tobago is in a damn mess and that the MRF, which treats in excess of 8,000 HIV/AIDS patients, is currently struggling financially. Bartholomew was speaking at a press conference held Monday at the MRF's offices at Queen's Park East, Port of Spain. He said it was a disgrace that the Foundation could not even afford to attend and present research papers at annual international HIV conferences abroad, because of a lack of funding. MRF financial resource manager Natasha Singh revealed that the Foundation currently owes in excess of $117,000 in rent and more than half a million dollars to various creditors. Bartholomew said for the past several years, the MRF has submitted yearly audited financial reports to the Ministry of Health, justifying the need for certain sums of money, without success. To add insult to injury, he said, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Colin Furlonge requested in a letter dated March 18 to the HIV/AIDS Co-ordinating Unit that the MRF and all other treatment centres provide a detailed report for the last ten years of HIV services provided including the number of new and repeat patients on a monthly basis. Bartholomew said this would be an exhausting procedure as the MRF is being asked to submit invoices for every single thing, including tissue paper. He said this move would further delay the disbursement of funds. Bartholomew said the lack of funds was affecting the delivery of services to patients as well as research efforts. Other issues raised by MRF staff was a shortage of essential HIV/AIDS drugs and CD4 kits as well as equipment that was more than a decade old. As a result of the shortage, patients have been switched to other drugs said Ingrid Marcelline, MRF chief pharmacist. And while patients would normally receive a three-month supply of medication, now they can only get a two-week supply, she said. Marcelline said the medication must be taken every day or the patient runs the risk of becoming resistant to the treatment. The shortage, she said, was putting lives at risk. When contacted by the Express, Health Minister Dr Fuad Khan assured that funding would be provided soon. ?Cabinet has passed a note, it is just a matter for the Ministry of Finance to organise it, he said.

    OPEN FOR DEBATE: Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar addresses the 25th Inter-Sessional meeting of the conference of Heads of Government of Caricom yesterday at Buccament Bay Resort in the St Vincent and the Grenadines. ?Photo courtesy The Office of the Prime Minister
    LEADERS of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) have agreed in principle that marijuana for medicinal purposes should be decriminalised, Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar stated yesterday.
    Persad-Bissessar however said no decision will be taken on the issue unless there is first consent from the people of Trinidad and Tobago.
    Persad-Bissessar made the statement yesterday while talking to members of the media following the opening ceremony of the 25th Inter-Sessional meeting of the conference of Heads of Government of Caricom.
    The two-day meeting is being held at the Buccament Bay Resort in the St Vincent and the Grenadines.
    According to a recent report released to The Associated Press, researchers with a Caribbean trade bloc have found that "decriminalising marijuana and exploring its use for medicinal purposes could help boost the region's sluggish economy".
    This issue of decriminalising marijuana for medicinal purposes was one of the issues Caricom leaders sought to discuss yesterday.
    Persad-Bissessar was yesterday asked about the issue.
    "That is on the agenda, it is also on the agenda but it is something whilst we agree in principle, it is something that we will have to really thrash back to our populations," Persad-Bissessar said.
    "I don't think as a responsible politician I would want to commit without getting consent from the people of Trinidad and Tobago on that issue," she said.
    Persad-Bissessar said other countries have already taken that step.
    "It is being done in other countries, it is being done with some States in the United States and it is definitely something that is worth considering for medical purposes," she said.
    She questioned what would be the end though.
    "The next step is private use in small amounts and where does it end, where does it go" she asked.
    Last year Uruguay became the first country to legalise the marijuana trade while several States in the United States have already implemented medicinal marijuana laws.
    Persad-Bissessar said the decriminalising of marijuana for medicinal purposes could have an economic impact on the region.
    "With no disrespect I am told they produce a lot of marijuana in this country (St Vincent and the Grenadines), no disrespect to them of course," she said.

    Persad-Bissessar said there is research both for and against the use of marijuana, and it may even have a positive impact on crime in the region.
    "The research goes either way. There's research that once you decriminalise it then the crime situations are lessened, there is research in that direction that when it is no longer on the black-market like everything else you can work into the parlour, the shop and buy and therefore the hiding and the stealing and the guns...that research says once you decriminalise it will assist in the fight against crime," Persad-Bissessar said.
    "Some say because it is not such a powerful narcotic as some others are they feel that that can be decriminalised and controlled and it may help in the fight against crime," she said.
    Persad-Bissessar said she has no personal view either way.
    "I have not made any view on that, we must have further discussion before that is done and of course when we have that before us we take that to Trinidad and Tobago for public discussions and consultations," she said.
    Persad-Bissessar, the outgoing chairman of Caricom, yesterday formally passed the chairmanship to St Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves.
    In his feature address, Gonsalves raised the issue of the decriminalising of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
    "We must have discussion on the regional policy regarding medical marijuana and the alteration of existing laws on the strict prescription of marijuana use for social and religious purposes," he said.

    Since the San Fernando Teaching Hospital was opened, I only had opportunity to view it from the outside.
    However, my uncle was admitted to the facility two weeks ago, so I had reason to see the inside for myself.
    What I saw was very, very impressive.
    First of all, there is a multi-level car park, which should not be so shocking, but if one knows the stressful experience it is to find parking at the old San Fernando hospital, they would understand why this is such a welcome feature.
    Then there are the rooms themselves. Four patients to a room, with state-of-the-art beds and facilities. The rooms were clean and the staff was very helpful.
    This could compare with some of the best public health facilities in the world. I must say this was a very well-executed project by the Government, and it should be commended for it.

    Pr1ivate hospitals and doctors are washing their hands of pregnant women who encounter complications and send them off to the public health sector to deal with says Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh.
    “Do you know that all the difficult cases that the private sector does not wish to handle, do you know where they send them?” asked Deyalsingh as he disclosed they are sent to the public hospitals in Port of Spain, Mount Hope, Sangre Grande and San Fernando.
    “Very often we get those mothers in their last trimester with serious complications and the doctors and the institutions in the private sector no longer want to handle them...the Attorney General he could tell you, he had to call me in a panic last year, somebody he knew was being refused treatment, could I accept, I said no problem, we’ll accept it, all the difficult cases do you know where they come to? The public health care system. Right now we have two women in our hospitals sent to us by the private sector that are touch and go and if something happens you know what the media would say? Is the public health care system,” said Deyalsingh.
    The Minister was speaking at the Parliament sitting yesterday on the debate on a motion to adopt the Report of the Standing Finance Committee on the consideration of proposals for the Supplementation and Variation of Appropriation 2018.
    Deyalsingh said he hates in when people refer to Mount Hope as Mount Hopeless because when it comes to maternal mortality over the years at public hospitals, the “shocking” story of the private doctors and institutions sending the complicated patients off via ambulance to the public hospitals have not been told.
    He said in this country there are approximately 17,000 live births per year and of that 90 per cent takes place in the public health sector.
    Deyalsingh said the public health sector cannot refuse a patient because it has a system which refuses no one.
    HE said when these patients are sent they are usually in their last month of pregnancy and there is no patient record or history and the public health sector is expected to bring that pregnancy to a successful end.
    Deyalsingh said the first day he entered office there was a maternal mortality and the week after there was another. However, he boasted that he worked to change this and within the first six months of entering office the maternal mortality rate was decreased.
    Deyalsingh also knocked the former People’s Partnership Government for the millions of dollars spent behind the Chronic Disease Assistance Plan (CDAP) programme whilst patients suffered.

    He said it cost $26 million in drugs per annum for the programme.
    The Minister said in the election year of 2015, the administrative cost for CDAP went to $46 million and that year a lucrative multi million dollar contract was given for health cards which the PNM Government had to pay - with some $3 million still outstanding.
    “So in one year the cost of drugs is $26 million, the administrative cost is$46 million and then you give you a contract for $30 million,...so that is $76 million to give out $26 million worth of drugs,” said Deyalsingh as he accused the former Government of using the health card system as a means to getting people’s private information.
    He also criticised Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar’s describing her contribution as “bloviation” - a term used to speak at length in an empty and inflated way.

    Archbishop Jason Gordon has called on the Government to take decisive action and pass national legislation on refugee issues.
    Gordon has launched an Archdiocese’s Ministry for Migrants and Refugees (AMMR) on observance of World Refugee Day tomorrow.
    He said it was time to commit to stand in solidarity with migrants and refugees and to promote their human rights.
    “This is essential if T&T is to meet its international obligations, having acceded in November 2000 to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.
    “These are the foundations of international refugee law. We call on the Government also to develop an efficient and secure asylum system. Let’s pray and act to ensure that there is a place at the table of life for all,” he said.

    affected by flooding: Fifty-year-old Premnath Badal, of Gopie Trace died on Saturday after contracting leptospirosis, a disease caused by rats. affected by flooding: Fifty-year-old Premnath Badal, of Gopie Trace died on Saturday after contracting leptospirosis, a disease caused by rats. FOURTEEN suspected cases of leptospirosis were recorded at San Fernando General Hospital this month. Two patients died but only one case was confirmed as the rat-borne illness, said South West Regional Health Authority (SWRHA) chief executive officer Gail Miller-Meade. The confirmed case was police officer Premnath Badal, 50, of Gopie Trace, Penal, who died last Saturday after having contracted leptospirosis. “IT was not a walkout, I said what I had to say. They (the media) saw it as a walkout. What is wrong with having a press conference and not wanting to have questions after?” A United National Congress (UNC) government will create 50,000 jobs for the jobless. This promise was made by Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar yesterday at the party’s 30th anniversary celebrations at the UNC’s Couva South headquarters. THE T&T Coast Guard continued a search for Venezuelan migrants who were aboard a pirogue which sank on Tuesday night near Patos Island, which is near the Dragon’s Mouth in the Gulf of Paria. IT was a night of dance moves with the “electric slide” by Marcia Griffiths, steelpan, soca and some jazz in between. THERE was a 5.2 magnitude earthquake that struck south-west of Trinidad rattling parts of South Trinidad and north-eastern Venezuela yesterday. As a small boat packed with Venezuelans capsized in waters between Venezuela and Trinidad on Tuesday night, Yubreilys Merchán found herself with seconds to react.

    A SHOCKING video has emerged showing the final hours of the life of an elderly man who was apparently removed from the Port of Spain General Hospital and placed outside the compound where he soiled himself and died overnight. The six minute, 50 second long video recorded by Facebook user Lystra Alexis showed the 80-year-old man writhing in pain on the grass along the pathway leading to the hospital's Accident and Emergency Department. The man said his name was Christopher Phillip and he lived Laventille. A conversation between the person recording the video and another woman told a story of how the man went to the casualty early that morning. It was unclear whether the man had received medical treatment. She said Phillip was asked to leave the compound, but was unable to walk as he appeared to be in pain. “I witnessed this at the Port of Spain General hospital this afternoon. Two MTS security officers lifting a very sick gentleman and placing him on the ground in the carpark. The gentleman was unable to stand or walk but he was discharged and they were instructed to remove him,” she said. The women attempted to seek help Phillip who complained that his legs were paining. His pants were soiled with blood, the women said. One of the women left to get help, but returned seconds later saying that she was told by security that the man was discharged and could not be taken back inside the A&E Department. She was advised to call an ambulance from the hospital to take him back to the facility. “When I enquired about him being given some sort of medical care, I was told by the security he cannot be taken back inside unless an ambulance brings him, because he was discharged. This is total madness . What is our country coming to This gentleman is 80 years old and this is how he was treated.,” she said. The man was never removed and he died at the entrance of the hospital on Wednesday. Police confirmed that the man was seen at the hospital's Accident and Emergency Department. He was found lying face down on the grass near the walkway to the casualty department at daybreak. Police said there were no visible marks of violence. The video has sparked outraged with many persons calling on Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh to demand a full scale investigation into the incident and to take action against those responsible for Phillip's death. Calls to Deyalsingh's phone on Wednesday went unanswered.

    Anthropologist Dr Kumar Mahabir will speak on the medicinal benefits of the saijan (moringa) plant on Saturday at the First Caribbean Moringa Symposium and Festival 2017 at the University of Trinidad and Tobago (UTT) Waterloo Research Station in Carapichaima.  In his presentation, Mahabir will talk about how drinking saijan tea regularly can reduce diabetes by regulating glucose levels, and can also reduce cholesterol levels by preventing further plaque build-up in the arteries.

    The saijan leaves have been shown to contain forty-six (46) types of anti-oxidants and over ninety-two (92) nutrients, making it one of the most powerful super foods globally. It is no wonder that the saijan plant has been described as “the miracle tree.” The symposium and festival are being organised by UTT and Moringa Interest Groups. The event, which beings at 9.00 a.m. is free and open to the public.
    Mahabir is an Assistant Professor at the UTT and is the author of the national bestseller Medicinal and Edible Plants used by East Indians of Trinidad and Tobago.

    TRINIDAD and Tobago's healthcare system is clearly in crisis. Billions spent by successive administrations have not addressed fundamental problems that have plagued the country's hospitals and health centres for decades. The 2017 national budget allocated the third highest amount to health care—$6.25 billion. But there are still too few public hospital beds; too many patients waiting years for life-saving surgeries; too many shortcomings in maintenance of vital equipment such as the recent fiasco with the CT (computerised tomography) scan­ners; the horrendously long time patients have to wait for health care...and the list goes on. Urgently needed me­di­cations run short while patients wait in long lines for prescriptions to be filled. Infant mortality remains a challenge while a brand new children's hospital lies dormant and unoccupied. So what went wrong and why can't the public health system be fixed In this new investigative series, the Sunday Express begins an examination of the issues, the people most affected by it and what the experts have to say about possible solutions.

    14 CHILDREN attending the Rio Claro Vedic Primary School fell ill and were taken to hospital today after being overwhelmed by a chemical smell. The Express was told that at around 10:20 a.m. the school had to be evacuated after several children complained of feeling nauseous and began vomiting. Fire Service and the paramedics responded. A fire official said the stench emanated from pesticides being used nearby. The children were taken to the district health facility in Rio Claro and some were transferred to the Sangre Grande and the San Fernando General Hospital.

    Former prime minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar is appealing to the Government to stop neglecting the Couva Children's Hospital. She said five months have passed and the Government has not taken full possession of the facility. Persad-Bissessar said yesterday, at the Siparia Women's Association's Kiddies Carnival in Penal: “The hospital was totally complete and outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment.”  A portion of the roadway leading to the Couva Children's Hospital collapsed on Monday.
    “There was some excavation works taking place which caused the collapse of that road and I hope the Government does not continue to neglect that site.
    “I trust that a few metres of the road that has caved does not give the Government further excuse for delaying the opening of that hospital,” Persad-Bissessar said.
    She said the People's Partnership was not responsible for the road slippage.
