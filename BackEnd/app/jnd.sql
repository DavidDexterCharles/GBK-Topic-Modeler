Cuba''s government announced on Tuesday, Dec. 4, 2018 that its citizens will be offered full internet access on mobile phones starting Thursday, Dec. 6, becoming one of the last nations to do so. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File) Cuba announced Tuesday night that its citizens will be offered full internet access for mobile phones beginning this week, becoming one of the last nations to offer such service. Mayra Arevich, president of the Cuban state telecom monopoly ETECSA, went on national television to say Cubans can begin contracting 3G service for the first time Thursday. Until now, Cubans have had access only to state-run email accounts on their phones. The Cuban government has been building a 3G network in cities across the island and some tourists, Cuban government officials and foreign businesspeople have had access to it for several years. The communist-governed island has one of the world''s lowest rates of internet use but that has been expanding rapidly since Presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente in 2014. Expansion has not slowed with President Donald Trump''s partial rollback of relations. Cuba authorized home internet in 2017 and hundreds of public Wi-Fi connection points have opened in parks and plazas around the country. The new service will cost about 10 cents per megabyte, with packages ranging from 600 megabytes for about $7 to four gigabytes for about $30. Those prices are roughly in line with global standards but still out of reach for many Cubans who subsist on state salaries of about $30 a month. Cuba ran a fiber-optic connection to Venezuela in 2012, allowing the island to shift from slow and costly satellite links. It then began the slow process of allowing citizens to get online. The government opened state-run internet cafes in 2013, joined by Wi-Fi sites two years later. The number of sites has grown to more than 800. The Cuban internet is mostly uncensored but the government blocks a small number of sites like the U.S.-funded Radio and Television Marti networks and others that advocate for systematic change on the island. ETECSA vice president Tania Velázquez said the new service would come online in stages from Thursday through Saturday to avoid the congestion that struck the mobile network during a series of heavily criticized tests this year.

Ma­haraj, how­ev­er, stood by his state­ment, say­ing it was the truth but said his re­sponse would come “af­ter the sea­son of good­will is over.” Ma­haraj drew the ire of many af­ter he at­tacked To­bag­o­ni­ans dur­ing on his TV Ja­gri­iti pro­gramme on Mon­day. “Noth­ing go­ing cor­rect in To­ba­go; they’re lazy. Six out of ten of them work­ing for the To­ba­go House of As­sem­bly, get­ting mon­ey from Port-of-Spain.

He al­so sug­gest­ed that oth­er able-bod­ied To­bag­o­ni­ans who were lazy pre­ferred to on­ly run crab and goat races and tar­get white women on beach­es whom they robbed and raped. A clip of Ma­haraj’s com­ments was soon shared on so­cial me­dia, prompt­ing an­gered re­spons­es on those plat­forms. Yes­ter­day, Duke called a press con­fer­ence at PSA head­quar­ters in Port-of-Spain where he con­demned Ma­haraj, say­ing the SDMS leader and his fol­low­ers should apol­o­gise or face a hate cam­paign from To­bag­o­ni­ans. “I wan­na tell Sat, any­time I know, any­time as Mi­nor­i­ty Leader in the To­ba­go House Of As­sem­bly, I know that you are in To­ba­go, we will give you a se­ri­ous un­wel­come and we will make your stay in To­ba­go hell,” Duke said. He added, “Some things you can leave silent, some things you have to lift your heel against. This is one. “He is look­ing for rel­e­vance in a coun­try that is far be­com­ing too large and too ed­u­cat­ed for his riffraff and his old chat. He has to find rel­e­vance by at­tack­ing any and every­one. Do the ho­n­ourable thing and apol­o­gise or you will face a hate cam­paign against you and against your or­gan­i­sa­tion.” Duke point­ed out that many To­bag­o­ni­ans work in Trinidad, par­tic­u­lar­ly those who had de­vel­oped skills which were not use­ful in the To­ba­go job mar­ket. In a Face­book post, Spir­i­tu­al Head of the Satya Anand Ashram, Pun­dit Satyanand Ma­haraj, slammed Ma­haraj’s com­ments as ob­scene and dis­gust­ing.

But even as the fam­i­ly is deal­ing with the trau­ma of their night of ter­ror, they be­lieve the po­lice could have pre­vent­ed it. On Sat­ur­day night around 10 pm, Niru­pa Esau, 28, was dropped off at her St Thomas Vil­lage home by her boyfriend. How­ev­er, she got an un­ex­pect­ed greet­ing when she en­tered. “As soon as I opened the door some­one grabbed me, pushed me in­side and said don’t scream. They pro­ceed­ed to my bed­room, gagged me and start­ed to ran­sack the home,” a tear­ful Niru­pa told Guardian Me­dia yes­ter­day amongst sev­er­al friends and rel­a­tives who had ral­lied to the fam­i­ly to show them sup­port. At first, Niru­pa said she was alone with the masked men but one hour lat­er her par­ents Mani­ram and De­o­raj Esau came home. “So when mom came she called me by my home name, but they then grabbed her, tied her up and threw her to the ground,” Niru­pa re­called. Niru­pa said her fa­ther was al­so re­strained be­fore the 49-year-old cater­er was beat­en about the body while the ban­dits de­mand­ed cash and valu­ables. One of her fa­ther’s teeth was knocked out dur­ing the as­sault. She said the men then took them to an out­side room one by one and one of the men stayed with them. It was dur­ing this time they thought they’d be killed. Around 2 am on Sun­day morn­ing the ban­dits left with cash and valu­ables. But their or­deal was far from over. When the fam­i­ly mem­bers fi­nal­ly freed them­selves they no­ticed the ground floor of their two-storey home on fire. “We screamed for the neigh­bour and he came with a grinder to try to open the bur­glar proof­ing be­cause they locked it,” Niru­pa said. With their neigh­bour’s help they were able to es­cape and even­tu­al­ly put out the fire. The fam­i­ly said this was the third time in five years they’d been at­tacked by crim­i­nals. “A few years back they robbed us then. Lat­er on, they al­so at­tempt­ed to mur­der my par­ents by break­ing their bed­room win­dow and start­ed to shoot. We don’t in­ter­fere with any­body, we are just hard work­ing cit­i­zens,” Niru­pa said, wip­ing the tears from her eyes. But the fam­i­ly be­lieves the po­lice could have pre­vent­ed this and even catch the crim­i­nals in the act. Niru­pa said her boyfriend grew sus­pi­cious when she did not an­swer his cus­tom­ary call to en­sure that she was safe­ly in­side her home Sun­day. She said the ban­dits forced her to an­swer once and tell him she was not feel­ing well and would speak with the fol­low­ing day. But she said this on­ly am­pli­fied his con­cern. Her boyfriend went to the Ch­agua­nas Po­lice Sta­tion but Niru­pa said his re­port was not tak­en se­ri­ous­ly. “They kind of in­sin­u­at­ed that this is a lover’s quar­rel and she will talk to you in the morn­ing, then they said they would fol­low him but turned away up­on reach­ing an in­ter­sec­tion,” she told Guardian Me­dia. The fam­i­ly’s home is on­ly five min­utes dri­ving dis­tance from that po­lice sta­tion. Niru­pa said on Sun­day they at­tempt­ed to make an­oth­er re­port but were told to get med­ical ex­ams at first and on­ly her fa­ther’s of­fi­cial state­ment was tak­en a day lat­er on Mon­day.

Sev­en years af­ter In­dia’s top bi­o­log­i­cal ex­pert Dr Av­varu Su­jatha made at­tempts to fight the red palm mite, Ce­dros co­conut grow­ers say their es­tates con­tin­ue to of­fer low yields be­cause of the spread of the dev­as­tat­ing preda­tor. The pro­duce is so min­i­mal that small­er es­tate own­ers are us­ing the co­conuts main­ly for oil pro­duc­tion and bot­tled co­conut wa­ter. A few sup­ply grat­ed co­conut to bak­eries for the pro­duc­tion of pas­tries. Dur­ing an in­ter­view with Guardian Me­dia, co­conut pro­duc­er Ivor Al­fred said his 12-acre es­tate has been de­stroyed by the mite. “A few years ago they brought ex­perts from In­di­an and African to fight this red palm mite. We had hope that the es­tates could be re­vived but our trees are con­tin­u­ing to die,” Al­fred said. He added that two years ago, he at­tempt­ed to re­plant the trees, some of which were al­most 100 years old. “It made no sense be­cause the new trees shriv­elled up and died,” Al­fred said. He said he has now start­ed to do in­ter-crop­ping. “I use the es­tate to plant paw­paw, pump­kins and figs. I sell what­ev­er lit­tle I get to the co­conut oil pro­duc­ers,” he said. There are about 10 co­conut oil pro­duc­ers in the south­west­ern penin­su­la among them Roopah Ma­haraj and her daugh­ter Nir­mala. Ma­haraj said the mite has wreaked hav­oc on co­conut pro­duc­tion. Man­ick Joseph who works in the pro­duc­tion of oil said the co­conut in­dus­try once pow­ered the econ­o­my in the south­west­ern penin­su­la. He said since the de­struc­tion of the es­tates, some peo­ple mi­grat­ed while oth­ers went in­to the fish­ing in­dus­try. In an in­ter­view, lo­cal gov­ern­ment coun­cil­lor for Ce­dros Shankar Teelucks­ingh said the sev­er­al co­conut es­tate own­ers in the penin­su­la were now trans­form­ing their once arable lands in­to hous­ing de­vel­op­ments. He said while co­conut was a lu­cra­tive crop, it was dy­ing in Ce­dros, main­ly be­cause of the mite. “We need a com­plete up­grade of the in­dus­try. The trees which are over 100-years-old need to be ploughed down and re­plant­ed. “The trees were sup­posed to be re­placed with fresh stock. Stud­ies were done by Cariri (Caribbean In­dus­tri­al Re­search In­sti­tute) and biotech­nol­o­gy was utilised to curb the red palm mite. How­ev­er, the trees were not re­plant­ed as promised by the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture,” Teelucks­ingh said. “We are still wait­ing for the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture to re­ha­bil­i­tate the in­dus­try. Teelucks­ingh said some co­conuts are sold be­tween $1.50 to $5 de­pend­ing on the size. He said in ar­eas out­side of the coast, the mite was caus­ing de­struc­tion. At Bun­see Trace, Pe­nal, an­oth­er farmer Raithraj Sook­nanan said he al­so plant­ed co­conuts but the trees have all died be­cause of the red palm mite. “The trees start to dry from the top and we don’t get any yield at all,” Sook­nanan said. Slow process to get for­eign plant ma­te­r­i­al—Ramb­harat Agri­cul­ture Min­is­ter Clarence Ramb­harat said there were some de­lays in get­ting the co­conut stocks from abroad. “We have co­conut cul­ti­va­tions all over the coun­try. The main is­sue is the slow pace of the ef­forts to im­port plant­i­ng ma­te­r­i­al from Brazil and Mex­i­co. New and more re­sis­tant va­ri­eties are what our farm­ers need,” he said. He not­ed that the de­struc­tion of the co­conut trees may be dri­ven by the eco­nom­ics of hous­es be­ing a bet­ter re­turn on in­vest­ment. Asked why there was a de­lay in get­ting the stock, Ramb­harat said, “Pest Risk As­sess­ments by the ex­porter and im­porter and in­tel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty is­sues- the sell­er re­tains in­tel­lec­tu­al prop­er­ty rights which makes it dif­fi­cult for us to re­pro­duce and share plant­i­ng ma­te­r­i­al.” Asked what plans the Gov­ern­ment had for the re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion of the co­conut in­dus­try and whether the mite could be erad­i­cat­ed, Ramb­harat said, “We can­not erad­i­cate red palm mite. We can re­duce the im­pact. I have fo­cused on mak­ing im­port­ed plant­ed ma­te­r­i­al avail­able. The in­cen­tives for agri­cul­ture are al­ready in place.” He added that the shift from co­conut to hous­ing has been hap­pen­ing for sev­er­al years now. About the red palm mite The red palm mite is a pest of the co­conut and oth­er palms in In­dia and many oth­er Asian coun­tries. The first West­ern He­mi­sphere re­port of red palm mite was from Mar­tinique in 2004 and it quick­ly spread to many oth­er Caribbean coun­tries, in­clud­ing T&T in 2006. Ini­tial symp­toms are dis­col­ora­tion of the leaves, while ad­vanced symp­toms in­clude yield loss. The mite has dev­as­tat­ed 80 per cent of the co­conut in­dus­try in coastal com­mu­ni­ties of Ce­dros, Ica­cos and Man­zanil­la. Why bi­o­log­i­cal con­trols did not work? In a re­sponse to an email from Guardian Me­dia, the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture agreed that harsh dry weath­er con­di­tions could in­crease the mite pop­u­la­tion. In a state­ment, the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture said a preda­to­ry mite A. lar­goen­sis (Acari: phy­to­sei­idae) was iden­ti­fied as a main in­dige­nous nat­ur­al en­e­my of the red palm mite. “Sur­veys for nat­ur­al en­e­mies con­duct­ed in T&T de­tect­ed Am­bl­y­seius lar­goen­sis as the pri­ma­ry preda­tor in all the ge­o­graph­i­cal ar­eas. Dr Av­varu Su­jatha (In­di­an tech­ni­cal ex­pert) was con­tract­ed to lead re­search ac­tiv­i­ties in ad­dress­ing this mite prob­lem. Dur­ing her tenure at the Min­istry, Dr Su­jatha con­duct­ed field, green­house and lab­o­ra­to­ry stud­ies through­out T&T,” the Min­istry said. “Re­sults from such stud­ies re­port­ed that red palm mite pop­u­la­tions were high­er in coastal co­conut es­tates when com­pared to in­land es­tates. Da­ta al­so showed an in­crease in red palm mite pop­u­la­tions dur­ing the dry sea­son and low­er pop­u­la­tions dur­ing the rainy sea­son. This coun­try is cur­rent­ly ex­pe­ri­enc­ing harsh dry sea­son con­di­tions and it is ex­pect­ed that an in­crease in red palm mite pop­u­la­tions may oc­cur,” the Min­istry added. Dur­ing the con­duct of rou­tine sur­veil­lance ac­tiv­i­ties, the Min­istry said preda­tors were al­so ob­served, along with the pest, name­ly Am­bl­y­seius lar­goen­sis. “The pres­ence of this preda­tor has al­so been re­port­ed to re­duce red palm mite pop­u­la­tions glob­al­ly. Since then, sev­er­al field stud­ies in­volv­ing the use of this preda­tor against red palm mite were con­duct­ed by the Re­search Di­vi­sion. Sur­veil­lance ac­tiv­i­ties are con­duct­ed rou­tine­ly to mon­i­tor pop­u­la­tion lev­els. An In­te­grat­ed Pest Man­age­ment ap­proach is rec­om­mend­ed,” the Min­istry said. Farm­ers are now be­ing en­cour­aged to con­tact the Re­search Di­vi­sion of the Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture to di­ag­nose the symp­toms ob­served ac­cu­rate­ly since low yields may be due to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors in­clu­sive of in­sect pest, dis­eases and oth­er dis­or­ders.” ', 4),

On Saturday, Digicel customers were issued a text message from the company advising that some third-party VoIP apps are no longer available. Digicel has blocked apps, including Viber, Tango, Nimbuzz and Fring. TSTT issued the release yesterday. "In response to media enquiries, bmobile declines from offering any comment on Digicel''s decision to block VoIP service providers," the release stated. "It should be noted, however, that VoIP is an inescapable feature of modern telecommunications. Bmobile''s policy on the matter, as far as use of VoIP on its mobile network is concerned, is that bmobile provides customers with a conduit to voice and data services. Customers pay a subscription fee for this access and once customers have bought data services from bmobile, customers determine how they wish to use their data. VoIP essentially is data on the mobile network much like e-mail, YouTube, social media or downloading apps and games," it stated. "Two years ago bmobile built a large Wi-Fi network we call bzones to complement the 4G network. Over 50 bzones have been deployed throughout Trinidad and Tobago because bmobile did not want to enter the 4G market with a ''one size fits all'' approach. These bzones are expansive Wi-Fi areas that bmobile customers can connect to and thereby conserve the data bundles they pay for." "At the same time, by taking that traffic off of the 4G network, it allows other customers who chose to use their 4G data bundles, to do so without any inconvenience. In the end therefore each local mobile provider must decide, based on what it knows of the capabilities of its network, how to treat with customers using VoIP," the release stated.

In their oblivious reinforcement of gender stereotypes, the advertisers seem to be missing the obvious that many of the new hi-powered equipment meant to make household work easier (and to encourage men to participate) are better meeting the needs of the expanding numbers of single, female-headed households. Some avid sociologists might want to take up this observation as further evidence of male marginalisation the new catchphrase in ongoing gender-based analyses. Meanwhile, clearly unknown to the advertisers, women are relinquishing the nagging, and are taking up newly invented high-powered easy-to-use equipment, and just doing it themselves. A friend of mine was engaged by a UK company some years ago to do market research on how women use technology. The growing purchasing power of women''s pocket books were making females more attractive subjects of scientific research and development as corporations did not want to miss out on the opportunity to bite into some of those hard-earned bucks. Cellphones and computers, for instance, were beginning to be turned out in pinks and reds and pastels to cater for the possible interest by women in these gadgets, of course, until someone thought that professional, self-supporting women''s interest in these tech toys might go beyond skin deep and beyond colour and cute, they might actually be interested in the applications and functions of these New Age devices. This research project has since evolved in the UK, into a television series called Lady Geek that ranges through the bewildering maze of new apps, particularly on smart phones, to help women understand which may be best suited to their needs. I have spent the last several years searching the shelves of technology for a basic household, uhh accessory. (Not quite an appliance, nor a tool, I have to call it a household cleaning accessory). Older generations would call it a mop. I have explored local and international household department stores. I have seen a world of mops, steamers and vacuum cleaners capable of handling various kinds of floors, hard or carpeted, but have not found one that can suit my needs, and that, very simply is a mop one with scrubbing and vacuum functions that dries as it wet-cleans, can cover 10,000 square feet of ground space in one cleaning without leaving its bristles or frayed fibres or microfibres in its wake because they cannot live up to the size of the task. Sometimes, frustrated in my quest, I may drift into tech stores, hoping against hope that some genius might have invented my dream mop as this year''s gadget of choice. To defray the inevitable disappointment, I may allow myself to be lured into the fascinating world of the newest smartphones, computers and their apps that have now been transported from our palms to the galaxy. Now there I can find almost everything I need from such a device, having evolved from wanting a phone that can be tucked into my bra where my mother tucked her wallet (let''s face it, where do you put it when you''re decked for an evening out!) to a device that serves most of my general on-the-go phoning, computing, surfing, reading, music, photographic and video needs with all the required applications and that can fit, if not into my bra, certainly in a neat purse without the danger of neck and back damage, slim-line, and of a colour of choice. So for those who were about to ask, if I can''t have a mop for Christmas, certainly a galaxy fits the tech tab.

It may be nothing more than a few fellas refusing to accept the inevitable consequences of advancing years, huffing and puffing their way through a Sunday morning football sweat. Or some athletic young men, putting aside their preoccupation with babes, bling and gang warfare (not necessarily in that order) and channelling all that pent-up energy and anger on the makeshift basketball court. Whatever it is, these anonymous occasions of loosely organised athletic activity seem to be much closer to the fundamental essence of sport than some of the global mega-events that preoccupy the attention of hundreds of millions of fans around the planet whose list of priorities is topped by the need to ensure that the cable TV bill is paid promptly and that a fraction of the monthly budget is set aside for the must-see pay-per-view events that crop up every now and then. More and more, we''re seeing that the competition is not in the event itself, but the duel of television executives and broadcasting companies to reinvent, rebrand and aggressively market variations from the traditional fare, or at least present the old stuff as something different, just to ensure that the target audience, which has so many options to choose from, stays interested. You look at a lot of international football and wonder what all the fuss is about. Mediocrity and boring predictability, even with enhanced crowd sound effects and an excitable commentator, is still mediocrity and boring predictability. Former national player Carlton Franco, back home for the launch of the Veteran Footballers Foundation two Sundays ago, wasn''t as harsh as that but essentially said the same thing when comparing the systems and regimented structure of the modern game with the improvisation (critics will say disorganisation) and intuitive thinking that was demanded in the days when he played in front of the Grandstand. Pete Sampras, still the holder of the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 14, was last week lamenting the growing one-dimensional nature of men''s tennis with the vast majority of players on the professional circuit Roger Federer is the one notable exception preferring to stay on the baseline and exchange booming groundstrokes and passing shots with their opponents, thanks in no small measure to advanced technology that gives the modern exponent more power of shot than even the champions of previous eras ever managed off their racquet strings. In the face of such repetitiveness, somebody with enough influence always comes up with a bright made-for-TV idea, like last year''s three-match series between Federer and Sampras or the one-off event that pitted Federer against Rafael Nadal, with one side of the court being carpet and the other clay. And let us not forget that Sir Allen Stanford''s "20/20 for Twenty" is just another manifestation of the attempt to cash in on the rising tide of popularity in this newest and shortest form of international cricket to the extent that it threatens the viability, if not the existence, of the traditional variety. Such gimmickry and artificiality fly in the face of what a sporting contest should really be about, but as long as there are enough people prepared to pay enough money for such glorified non-events, they will continue to prosper. Which is why Oscar de la Hoya and Manny Pacquiao met in the ring in Las Vegas on Saturday night for a non-title event that was typical of the stage-managed sideshow that professional boxing has become. This latest so-called "Superfight" ended after the eighth round with the 29-year-old Filipino, generally regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter today, dominating the American from start to premature finish. De la Hoya, stopped for only the second time in his 16-year professional career, hardly mustered a serious challenge and later conceded that he didn''t have what it takes anymore, physically, to be competitive with the very best in the business. Yet his lack of energy would be no surprise to those familiar with the challenges of a heavier fighter losing a considerable amount of weight to make the 147lb welterweight category, a division that de la Hoya hadn''t fought at for seven years. Indeed, it was speculated that, in the time between the weigh-in the previous day and the opening bell on Saturday night, de la Hoya would have been back up almost to 160lbs, all of which would have taken a serious toll on his effectiveness when it really mattered in the ring. On the other hand, Pacquiao had to move up two weight classes to compete as a welterweight, a task the medical experts say would not have been as challenging and physically taxing as the weight-loss that de la Hoya had to undergo to meet the requirements of the fight. So why go through all of that for a manufactured contest in which there was no title at stake We all know what the answer is of course: money. Pacquiao earned US$11 million, his biggest purse ever. But hear this. Despite enduring the beating of his life, de la Hoya is expected to collect almost twice that amount by the time the revenue from the pay-per-view audience is assessed. Not even the old saying about the victor taking home the spoils holds true anymore in this upside-down, wheeling-and-dealing world of contemporary professional sport. At least there''s always the Savannah.

(Keith Bedford/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool, File) BOSTON (AP) — Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez hanged himself Wednesday in the prison cell where he was serving a life sentence for murder, taking his life on the same day his ex-teammates on the New England Patriots were set to visit the White House to mark their Super Bowl victory. His death came less than a week after the 27-year-old athlete was acquitted in a second murder case. Guards found Hernandez just after 3 a.m., Correction Department spokesman Christopher Fallon said. The onetime tight end was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later. Hernandez had been housed in a single cell in a general population unit at the maximum-security state prison in Shirley. He tied one end of a bedsheet to a window and tried to jam the cell door to prevent guards from opening it, Fallon said. Fallon said he was not aware of any suicide note. He said officials had no reason to believe Hernandez might take his life, and if they had had had any such worries, he would have been transferred to a mental health unit. A star at the University of Florida who dropped to the fourth round of the NFL draft because of misbehavior in college, Hernandez was a productive tight end for the Patriots for three seasons. In his second year, he caught 79 passes for 910 yards and seven touchdowns and helped the team reach the Super Bowl. In 2012, he signed a five-year, $40 million contract extension. But when the Patriots returned to the playoffs the next season, Hernandez was unable to even watch on television while he was in prison awaiting trial in one shooting and already a suspect in another. The team released him in June 2013, shortly after he was arrested in the killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez''s fiancee. He was convicted and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Last Friday, Hernandez was acquitted in the deadly 2012 drive-by shootings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston. Prosecutors said he gunned them down after one of the men accidentally spilled a drink on him in a Boston nightclub. Earlier in the week, cameras spied Hernandez blowing kisses to the young daughter he fathered with fiancée Shayanna Jenkins. His death was "a shocking and sad end to a very tragic series of events that has negatively impacted a number of families," said Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn, who prosecuted Hernandez in the Lloyd case. Prosecutors suggested Lloyd may have been killed to keep him quiet about the 2012 Boston killings. Hernandez''s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Patriots had no immediate comment. Authorities opened an investigation into the death. MARCUS JOHN has been denied bail for allegedly burning the hands of a three-year-old boy and… A 30-year-old man, who was wanted in connection with a TT$2 million drug bust in November 20… The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service has moved its policing status back to Red alert until… THE Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT) has backed away from further action against Sat Maharaj over his controversial Tobago statements, following discussions yesterday between the agency’s corporate secretary and lawyers for the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha (SDMS) general secretary.

One year ago this week, she broke the gender barrier becoming the first full-time paid female assistant coach in the NBA. Now Hammon''s happy to see she''s no longer the only woman in the profession. Nancy Lieberman accepted an assistant coaching job the other day with the Sacramento Kings, and the Arizona Cardinals made Jen Welter the NFL''s first female coach last week. “I think anything is possible,” Hammon said Sunday before the New York Liberty honoured her at a game. “Just because something''s never been done doesn''t mean it can''t be done. Leadership has no gender. The point is, do you know basketball Do you know what it takes to lead people” Clearly for Hammon, the answer was yes. The 5-foot-six former WNBA star once hoped to play in the NBA. Now she''s a trailblazer of a different sort. “If you have a daughter, or even a woman in your life, it is worth supporting because of the bigger picture, because of the opportunities it will lead to down the road for little girls,” Hammon said. “We''re not asking the male to get up and leave his seat. We''re just saying scoot over a little bit. Make a little room at the table for the ladies.” Hammon said she hasn''t had a chance to chat with Lieberman yet since she was hired, but the two did talk when they were both coaching in the Las Vegas summer league last month. “First, I''m very proud of Becky as much as I''m proud of Jen Walter. I''m friends with both of them,” Lieberman said. “Just to see the opportunities that they got. Becky opened up a lot of doors even for myself with what the Spurs did and then with her success at the summer league. It has an effect on a lot of people''s thinking and the acceptance.” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sees Hammon and Lieberman as the start of something. He has “no doubt” there will be a female head coach one day. “I think just like we''ve seen enormous change in our society, just in the last decade, I think that''s another ceiling, another barrier that will be broken,” Silver said last month. “And it takes women like Becky being out there. You need pioneers, and there''s been other pioneers before her, but I think you couldn''t ask for more of a complete package in terms of former player, student of the game and someone who''s able to work within a strong organisation like the Spurs.” Hammon knows that timing can mean everything. She tore a knee ligament in 2013 and instead of playing overseas decided to stay in Texas and rehab the injury. She asked Stars coach Dan Hughes if coach Gregg Popovich and Spurs general manager RC Buford would mind if she “popped her head in on a few practices.” Soon after she was attending all of the Spurs'' coaches meetings and film sessions. She acknowledges that such an arrangement might not have worked with another team, and she''s thankful San Antonio gave her a chance. She hasn''t disappointed them, helping guide the Spurs summer league team to a championship in Las Vegas last month. “Someone had to be brave enough to do the right thing and not care about gender,” Hammon said. “I hope we get to the point in society where this is not news anymore and (it becomes) ''We hired this person because they are best for the job.''” Veayon Joseph and Mississippi State University freshman Tyriq Horsford are set to successful… Legal counsel for the recently-sacked Cricket West Indies selection panel, Tony Astaphan, has slammed comments by Cricket West Indies president Ricky Skerritt regarding their removal, and also plans to challenge the manner of their dismissal in court.

Khalifa St Fort opened her 2019 campaign with victory at the Rafer Johnson and Jackie Joyner-Kersee Invitational in California, USA, last Saturday. The Florida-based sprinter topped the women’s 200 metres field in 23.52 seconds.

It therefore comes as a shock that almost one month later, the debt remains unpaid. In response, the players are considering withholding their services from next month''s qualifier for the Copa America Centenario in Panama. The players'' frustration is understandable. Having agreed to wait until after the T&T-US match for the fees owed to them from the game against Guatemala, they could not have expected to start preparing for yet another match without payment. It is difficult to understand why the Raymond Tim Kee-led administration did not meet their obligations to the team and staff before the November 29 election in which Mr Tim Kee was voted out as president of the Trinidad and Tobago Football Association. Between the advance sale of seats, match sponsorship and sale of media rights, the TTFA should have had enough money in hand to have cheques ready as the players left the field. It is the height of unprofessionalism that the players should be operating on the basis of a “gentleman''s agreement” with the TTFA and not on the basis of firm contracts. Nonetheless, having committed to such an arrangement, Mr Tim Kee should not have left the payments in abeyance and saddled a new administration with the responsibility of settling debts without the requisite paperwork The situation has been exacerbated by the change in administration by which Mr Tim Kee was replaced by David John-Williams as new president. Since coming into office two weeks ago, Mr John-Williams says his administration has been working hard to establish the TTFA''s finances. Knowing the record of the TTFA and its predecessor TTFF, this is no easy task. However, Mr John-Williams, who has had a long career on the financial side of football, should recognise the priority of the TTFA''s obligation to the players and staff who constitute the heart and soul of the country''s bid to penetrate the top tier of the world''s football ranks. It has long been acknowledged that such advance requires a more professional approach to football administration which would involve, among other things, clear contractual obligations between players and administration. If the new TTFA administration can achieve this objective it would be a revolutionary break from the past of arbitrary management. While he attends to such larger goals, however, the new TTFA president must deal with the urgent situation that is taking a toll on the national men''s team. The players and staff should not become victims to a change in administration which requires that they stand in line while the new administration sorts out the TTFA''s finances. The TTFA is asking too much of them by demanding their best without the financial compensation that is due to them.

I think the members of the Jamaican Cricket Association initially got it right and sent the perfect message when they chose to support Barbadian Joel Garner in the run-up to the presidential elections. ? ? THE late scholar, Lloyd Best, often made the prescient observation that everyone in Trinidad and Tobago feels like a second-class citizen. Be they ethnic and/or religious groups, rural or urban populations, Tobagonians or Trinidadians Most Trinbagonians utterly abhor racism, bigotry and prejudice. Just like we abhor asylum seekers, Chinese people and economic data by the World Bank.

Admissions by Finance Minister Colm Imbert at the PNM meeting in Barataria last Tuesday certainly serves to confirm the feelings of the general population.

Olympic Hero Book Cover: The cover of the book Olympic Hero, Lennox Kilgour?s Story. When Joanne Kilgour Dowdy set out to write a children''s book last year she didn''t think she would be writing about her father, deceased Olympian Lennox Kilgour. She had already gathered information from writers and illustrators with experience in writing children''s books and was ready to start when she got a strong feeling that the book''s focus should be on her famous father. "I believe it was December 26, my mind told me to start writing a book about (him)," the Kent State University Professor of Adolescent/Adult Literacy recalled. "It was a pretty demanding process because the whole story was rushing out of me. I just had to keep up with the ideas and the typing process." Olympic Hero, Lennox Kilgour''s Story is the product of Kilgour-Dowdy''s months of work. With illustrations by Dillon Sedar, the book is a testimonial to Kilgour''s endurance and faith in his ability to excel. Sedar, a student art teacher at Seiberling Elementary and an art educator/artist at Kent State University in Ohio, USA, was described by Kilgour Dowdy as a gift to her and the project. "I did pray to Lennox to send me someone who he approved of and wanted to do this journey with me. Dillon accepted my invitation to do the book the very next day." She added that she and the young artist are of one mind and quickly solve problems creatively by sharing their ideas and negotiating points of view to make decisions. "Truly this book is as much Dillon''s as it is mine. I hope other people see the gem that I have uncovered in his artistry." Kilgour Dowdy, whose last outing with her autobiography In the Public Eye and whose past titles include Readers of the Quilt: Essays on Being Black, Female and Literate and GED Stories, said Olympic Hero felt like a letter to young people. "I have written it like a poem, even though it does not look like a poem on the page. It unfolds in episodes, you could say. The illustration helps to make concrete what I am describing in each entry on the page. "Since it is a children''s book, I wanted them to come away with a "can do" message from the story. "Certainly I would not be a professor who writes for a living without the example of endurance and self-confidence that I witnessed in my parents." When her father won the bronze medal in the 1952 Summer Olynmpics in Helsinki, Finland she was not yet invented (her words). She had to rely on the book Trinidad Olympians written by Dr Basil Ince (who also reviewed her drafts and gave her some advice) and Alec Chapman (who she said was a great support to Ince when he researched on the Olympians) to fill in the blanks. "I never saw my father compete. I was too young to witness those events. I only saw his barbells and exercise equipment in the small room that he kept at the back of the house on Lucknow Street in St James. This is why doing the research for the book was so important to me. "I had to unearth the facts of his journey in order to appreciate who he was and what he had accomplished by the time that I met him in the world." Kilgour Dowdy felt that her father left her in good hands with Ince and Chapman and others who have provided their pictures and anecdotes Kilgour died in 1994 but it was only last year that Kilgour Dowdy felt she was ready to deal with his death. "So when the book is out in 2014 it will be 10 years since we buried him. That seems a good amount of time to adjust to his physical absence." Emotionally, writing Olympic Hero has been an envigourating journey. "I always talk to people about Lennox as if he is still physically present when I tell them about episodes in my writing journey. His spirit is very real to me. If people find that strange, that''s okay." Although she shares some her father with the world there are some memories of him that she keeps in her heart. As a girl she would often shine her father''s trophies. She also remembered him riding his bicycle for years before he took to the motorcycle. "His life as an athlete was all history to me when I start remembering his days with me. He was painting, I was a model for one of his paintings. He was sculpting. I remember the bust he made of Edward Taylor, the former mayor of Port of Spain. (Taylor) was the only person who met Lennox at the airport after he returned from Helsinki which his bronze medal. "That story is in the children''s book because I use it to show that Lennox did not let that disappointment stop him from pressing on to his next victories as an international athlete." The personal stories, Kilgour Dowdy said, are for another book. "So, now I have new work to look forward doing." Comparing Olympic Hero to her past body of work, Kilgour Dowdy thinks this is is a treasure that she has been digging for over the last 15 years. "The academic books got me to this point where I can write from the heart with the joy of knowing that I have my bills covered and no one is going to say that I am escaping my duties as a researcher by doing a children''s book about an athlete." She wants people to get that she is promoting all the habits that she has instilled in her pupils — research, collaboration with an illustrator to represent the facts that she is describing and encouraging reading in young people, which she called a daily challenge in this "movie and television culture that we have created". The book, which is being published by Caribbean Studies Press is also a filmscript for a short film that Kilgour Dowdy plans to do when Olympic Hero hit the shelves next year. Once a release date is fixed for the book its author will start talking to people about launching here and the rest of the Caribbean. "It would be wonderful if readers think of this book as a testimonial to a young man''s faith in himself and that they appreciate the role of learned elders in the lives of those who take on the work of shaping youth for success. Kilgour Dowdy wrote Olympic Hero with children in Standard 5 to Form 3 in mind but said adults could also learn a thing or two about the local sport hero. "Every person who has ever celebrated the struggle and victories of our athletes is warmly remembered in this book. I hope and pray that others will pick up their pens and their paint brushes and get busy documenting the lives of our heroes and sheroes for our nation to keep them in their hearts and hands. " My work is always about community, about celebrating the people in our community and in that spirit I offer another example of the stories that we need to tell and sooner rather than later."

', 'https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/swimming-with-sharks/article_46dabb3e-c14c-52cc-aeab-b2ef18a32dd6.html', 'Jun 11, 2014 ', ' WE met the first shark resting under the shelter of an overhang. He was small in body, probably about six feet long. We drifted over him and encountered our second shark under the elongated lid of another overhang. My buddy and I signalled to Aurora to draw closer with the camera. Fighting against a strong drift we approached the shark. This one was huge, over ten feet long. Because the water was spotted with tiny particles, visibility was not as good as we would have liked. The shark moved slightly but Aurora continued to go closer. The drift was so strong that it was a battle to reach for and pull her feet in an attempt to draw her away from such close proximity to this large selachian species. It was then that we realised that there were three sharks in the hollow of the coral as a second shark came cruising out and passed between us and the first. This one was also over ten feet long. A third showed his presence at the entrance and remained there. The second shark gracefully swam past us and re-entered the shelter at the tail end of the first. These were sand sharks, generally not known to be aggressive to humans. They inhabit shoreline habitats such as our Cove Reef. If feeling threatened, however, the sand shark will defend itself. It was wise in this case to remain some distance away so as not to agitate this large fish. We surrendered ourselves to the persistent strong drift and passed on to more sharks among the coral. This was true adventure on the Cove Dive Site. Cove is a very advanced dive because of the strong drift coming in with the currents of the Atlantic into the Caribbean Sea. Alvin Douglas of Frontier Divers Tobago Ltd took us out in his boat towards a dive site that we would always remember. We had left the calm waters of the Shallows of Pigeon Point and rounded the south western tip of Tobago where we encountered rough waters. The strong winds coming across only whipped up the waters to greater turbulence. Reaching the dive site, we rolled overboard without delay and just as quickly submerged towards the reef. Our swim was effortless as the strong drift took us along at its own pace. Cove Reef teemed with fish. Equally as impressive was the wide variety of colourful corals. Those that reached up to some height grew tilted towards one general direction because of the influence of the current. Small fish colonised the interior of barrel corals while larger fish cruised over the reef. These seemed unperturbed by the strong drift. A green moray eel peered out of her shelter. We could see the rest of her long body stretched out against the back of the cave. Two lobsters waved their limbs outside their shelter. They too remained where they were. A sting ray rested on the sandy sea bed fringing the reef. She seemed to be enjoying sweet repose. Further along we met our first sand shark and realised that Cove Reef was just teeming with this species. Some cruised along with the drift while others rested under the numerous overhangs characterising the reef. Later, they would emerge from their rest spots and hunt for the night. The presence of such a large number of sharks was the highlight of our scuba adventure at Cove Dive Site.

It apparently took an instruction from the latter to get him to visit the school that had been closed for nine weeks. This is despite the visit by the school''s PTA on October 11, to his offices with then three weeks old complaints about non-functioning toilets and other infrastructural woes. After that meeting he said, “if a child is out of school for one day that is a day too much…we are going to ensure that the time away is curtailed”. Last week he complained that “children were being used as pawns” and asserted “he will not speak (to parents as opposed to the PTA) if you cannot address me properly”. The counter position articulated by a parent is, “I get big and still duncey. I don''t want that for my son…I do everything for him to have a better life and this is what is going on here”. This exchange captures the need for us to reflect on the issue of respect in our society. Be it this case or one in Laventille we all desire respect. A lack of respect is wounding since it fails to acknowledge that another human being is worthy. By according respect to only the highly placed, we create a man-made shortage for respect since it costs nothing to be respectful to each other. In an age of inequality where some lose control over their lives becoming consumers of whatever is provided rather than participants in crafting the necessary solutions respect is even more desired. Respect, or its lack, reveals personal character in situations of inequality. We experience it daily in our hospitals and on our roads. Those who lead, be they government or opposition, should avoid pity or contempt in dealing with the needs of the public. Their example may help us regain mutual respect. Treating people with respect does not just happen; it is a negotiated position between our character and social structure. We have to distinguish between our position in society and our prestige which is the result of emotions ascribed by others to us in that position. Status does not automatically lead to prestige as Minister Garcia and President Carmona, one of the school''s graduates, have discovered. Disrespecting others comes naturally though we fight to keep from being disrespected ourselves. But society cannot function without restraint and adherence to recognised forms of behaviour. Therefore we cannot only show love to our friends and family and be indifferent to other social relations. As Otis Redding sang “what you want you got it…all I''m asking for is a little respect”. THE late scholar, Lloyd Best, often made the prescient observation that everyone in Trinidad and Tobago feels like a second-class citizen. Be they ethnic and/or religious groups, rural or urban populations, Tobagonians or Trinidadians Most Trinbagonians utterly abhor racism, bigotry and prejudice. Just like we abhor asylum seekers, Chinese people and economic data by the World Bank. Notre Dame stands for France, more than the Statue of Liberty stands for the US, Westminster Abbey for Britain or the Red House for Trinidad and Tobago. The advent of the Internet has opened the world to endless possibilities and connecti­vity. However, unscrupulous persons have been using social media to facilitate human trafficking. Admissions by Finance Minister Colm Imbert at the PNM meeting in Barataria last Tuesday certainly serves to confirm the feelings of the general population. The minister in his fiery speech indicated that “now is the time for action’’ and now we are going to see progress in 2019 right up to 2020—56 election year. The Honourable Dr Keith Rowley, Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who is the proud son of Tobagonian parents, no longer has to wait to hear from the UNC Opposition Leader Kamla Persad -Bissesar SC concerning the hate speech from the head of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, Satnarayan Maharaj.

That the Equal Opportunity Act became necessary and yet required an Indo-Trini party (United National Congress) to resort to the Privy Council for proclamation and effect of its initiative, adequately affirms the adamant policies of the dominant Afro-Trini party (People''s National Movement) which, for years, denied its approval of State discrimination in unequal hiring and appointments to State boards, in the face of which the disparaging use of the term "Petrosingh" by the latter''s leader rankled many even more. Glaring inequitable ethnic policies that may have had added impetus from Indo reluctance to participate as State employees, caused the long-serving UNC leader to address this issue through the years. He has always been unafraid to confront issues squarely. Nizam Mohammed''s firing was difficult to avoid because of his abrasiveness and personal style. The successor government was forced to remove him in order to bring about more delicately what he rampagingly approached. The beneficiaries of years of inequitable patronage were not responsible en masse for their leaders'' malpractices. Dr Ryan''s assertion that he was fired for what he did not say is to be rued. Mr Gregory Aboud''s metaphor is most apt. A scalpel was needed, not a cutlass. It will take time to redress imbalances, and patience is required from all.

Dr Ryan lamented the obvious racial imbalance in favour of Indo-Trinidadians in the medical profession and concluded that the lack of trust and discomfort of the Afro-Trinidadian community was a "very good reason why, in a society such as this, it was inadvisable to have a health system in which 80-plus per cent of the doctors are of one ethnicity". The Indo-Trinbago Equality Council (ITEC) wishes to make the following observations/comments: 1. The preponderance of Indian doctors is not limited to Trinidad and Tobago. A similar phenomenon exists in North America and the United Kingdom where a disproportionate number of doctors are Indian. 2. There is merit in the state having as a policy objective, the need for racial diversity in the medical profession. However, Ryan admitted that the ethnic imbalance is reversed in the nursing profession but made no similar call for an increase in the number of Indo-Trinidadian nurses. 3. Dr Ryan supports the call by Dr Courtenay Bartholomew and Dr Selwyn Cudjoe for the internationally accepted entry requirements to be varied to allow Afro-Trinidadian students to study medicine but remains silent about the similar call made by the Indo-Trinidadian community for inclusion in the army, police service, prison service, fire service, coast guard and the public service in general. 4. Dr Ryan has never commented about the inequitable and biased distribution of state housing to Afro-Trinis to the virtual exclusion of Indo-Trinis. Such inequitable distribution of state resources cannot be right and violates the right to equality of treatment in our constitution. 5. Dr Ryan never commented on the fact that Indian students'' entry in the medical school is based not on affirmative action, or secret scholarship but academic achievement. Should the nation''s security services not reflect the ethnic composition of the society it intends to protect and serve The sight of fully armed Afro-Trinidadian police officers and soldiers bullying Indo-Trinidadians protesters is a common one. One needs only to recall Prime Minister Manning''s famous response to the Caroni protest that he will beef up the riot squad. At present, the hierarchy of the security services and the entire public service is over 90 per cent African and not even a beep is heard about this fact from Dr Ryan despite several successful legal cases of proven discrimination. The CEO''s and chairman of all state enterprises and the special multi-purpose companies are also 90 per cent non-Indian. Dr. Ryan''s voice of reason is far too important to be one-sided and he should resist the temptation to jump out in defence of one ethnic group alone. ITEC therefore looks forward to his piece on "racial hyperconsciousness" of the PNM and Afro-Trinidadians when it comes to these other areas where the racial imbalance is reversed and the shoe is on the other foot.

In Mexico for instance, nearly 60 per cent of the nation''s extreme poverty is concentrated in rural areas, according to the report, and the rural illiteracy rate is 15.6 per cent, while it''s only 4.3 per cent in urban areas. Latin America''s poorest rural territories also have limited access to health care. In Mexico''s Mixtla de Altamirano Municipality, 700 of every 1,000 live-born babies will die in their first year of life, according to the report. In 530 other municipalities across the country, the rate is less than 1 in 1,000, and the national average is 17.6 children in every 1,000. The report made possible through funding from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the International Development Research Centre - Canada (IDRC) highlights the causes of extreme inequality, territorial achievement gaps and lack of opportunities in Latin America''s rural sector, analysing socio-economic indicators in health, education, economic dynamism and employment, income and poverty, citizen security, and gender equality from ten Latin American countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru. The in-depth study paints a picture of a region of extreme haves and have-nots, of nuanced territorial differences even within the rural sector and of failed and successful national policies for rural poverty reduction that have both contributed to overall poverty reduction and in some cases exacerbated the issue. "Overall much of Latin America is making solid advances in reducing extreme poverty and closing the inequality gap," said Josefina Stubbs, Director of IFAD''s Operations in Latin America and the Caribbean. "Nevertheless, much work needs to be done in closing these gaps and in creating dynamic public policies." According to the report''s analysis, Mexico''s public policies of the last 20 years have actually served to increase poverty and inequality in rural Mexico. For example, in Mexico''s ten richest municipalities, the average per capita earnings are around US$32,000, while in the poorest they are just US$603 per year. "When we see, for example, that the average GDP per capita of the richest municipalities is 50 times higher than that of the poorest, we need to ask ourselves how we are distributing the wealth of our country," said Jos Antonio Mendoza, Technical Secretary of the Rural Dialogue Group, an IFAD- and RIMISP-backed programme that is bringing top-thinkers from Latin America together to discuss issues of poverty and inequality across the region. According to Mendoza, the figures from the Latin America Report "harshly illustrate the extensive territorial inequalities that relegate many of our compatriots from the rural areas and future generations to a life of deficiencies and lack of opportunities. We hope that this study will be a tool for decision makers in the design of solutions and public policies for development in rural Mexico." The study also reveals two noteworthy challenges that concentrate differently on the urban and rural territorial level. Urban areas in the region are primarily facing challenges of inequality, security and economic dynamism, according to the report, while rural areas show lags in access to services and basic rights such as health and education. Gender equality is also a major issue in rural territories. And the poorest territories are often those with the highest concentrations of indigenous and afro-descendent peoples. "In the case of Mexico, the study recognises that the differences started growing decades ago, and in the countryside there are still extreme territorial inequalities between the states of the north and the south, and between subsistence and commercial producers," said Stubbs. "The first step in confronting this issue is to empower small-scale producers and rural entrepreneurs to take the reigns of their own destiny and transform family agriculture into a profitable and sustainable business." The Latin American Report shows how some social indicators and policies that are managed on a national level may not take into account the large differences that exist between territories and regional contexts. In Mexico, for example, the highest level of spending on rural development programmes is concentrated in the richest states. "The fact that there are large economic and social gaps in Mexico between the rural and urban sector and within the rural sector itself illustrates the differentiated models of economic development that have not been rectified in our nation," said Mendoza. "This makes it even more urgent a third generation of reforms that target these efforts in an effective manner, decentralize poverty reduction social programmes, and reduce the gaps that separate the north and south of the republic." “I NEVER heard a thing.

Leela Ramdeen I watched the video-clip on Facebook in which six girls in school uniform at a school in North T&T were allegedly smoking marijuana. The minister has called for a report, the girls’ suspension has been extended, and the matter has been referred to the police. Education Minister Anthony Garcia was rightly “greatly disturbed” by the video on Instagram which showed two of the suspended girls boasting about their deeds. This is a wake-up call for all our families and schools to be alert to this danger. Inter alia, the incident should lead us to reflect on issues relating to home/school/community links. The Government is currently holding consultations on the issue of the decriminalisation of cannabis in T&T. The AG has said that legislation on this issue will be brought to Parliament in the first half of 2019. See Archbishop Jason Gordon’s view on this issue in Catholic News, October 6, 2018. It is worth noting the words of philosopher Rudolph Steiner, who said: “In raising children, we need to continuously keep in mind how we can best create the most favourable environment for their imitative behaviour. Everything done in the past regarding imitation must become more and more conscious and more and more consciously connected with the future.” Promoting and protecting our children/family life is a justice issue. Parents have a key role to play in conscience formation and character building. And these must be critical elements of our education system. Families today face many challenges. We cannot sit on the sidelines and ignore the many social ills that impact adversely on them. The Catholic Catechism tells us that: “The family must be helped and defended by appropriate social measures. Where families cannot fulfil their responsibilities, other social bodies have the duty of helping them and of supporting the institution of the family” (CCC,2209). The 1983 Catholic Charter of the Rights of the Family defines family as “a community of love and solidarity, which is uniquely suited to teach and transmit cultural, ethical, social, spiritual and religious values, essential for the development and well-being of its own members and of society” (Compendium #229). It is in the family that our young people first learn moral and spiritual values and virtues, which give meaning to their lives. St Pope John Paul II reminded us years ago that: “The future of humanity passes by way of the family.” He referred to the family as “a society in its own original right”, and the “first and vital cell of society.” It is in the family that we will develop a culture of life; a spirit of nation-building. And see his apostolic exhortation called: “The Christian Family in the Modern World’’ (Familiaris Consortio, 1981). In it, he said: “…the essence and the role of the family are in the final analysis specified by love. Hence the family has as its mission to guard, reveal and communicate love.” When last did you hug your loved ones in your family and tell them that you love them? I attended the inaugural two-day national Symposium on the Family— held at The UWI in June 2018 on the theme: “Supporting Families as the Bedrock of our Society”. It was organised by the Ministry of Social Development and Family Services. The partner host was the Division of Gender and Child Affairs, Office of the Prime Minister. It incorporated “the official launch of a National Values, Attitudes and Behaviours Campaign for Trinidad and Tobago, which is key to fostering family life and driving sustainable social development.” The challenge is to move from policy to implementation/evaluation and for institutions such as the Children’s Authority to be fully staffed to deal with the matters before it. If we are to realise the vision of building strong families and a strong nation, we should not simply look to Government for solutions to our social ills. We must also look to our communities for role models and mentors to encourage, challenge and enthuse those who are at risk. John Rohn’s words are instructive. He said: “Your family and your love must be cultivated like a garden. Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationship flourishing and growing.” We need to take stock of where family life is and where it’s going. Families matter. Let’s stand up for the family. Investing in families is investing in society as a whole. Therefore, let’s invest in our families and build a society in which they can flourish. IT has taken a long time for the Government to begin to acknowledge what was evident from the beginning about the Dragon gas deal. MANY aspects of this society proceed on the momentum of the past. Memory is stored in the civil service, or the teaching service. These do not change when governments change so past practices endure. AMID the murder and mayhem, an even darker threat emerged in Trinidad and Tobago during Holy Week. Last Wednesday, with suspicious sloppiness, the Telecommuni­cations Authority of Tri­nidad and Tobago (TATT) wrote to Central Broadcasting Services (CBS), parent company of Radio and TV Jaagriti, of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, led by secretary general Sat Maharaj, warning of a breach of its broadcast code. AN entire Lent passed the calypso season, and the leggo licence exploited by Cro Cro, at the steering wheel, when not at the microphone. AN innocent man died. He was murdered because He was framed and the system of justice failed Him. Whether you are Christian and celebrating the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday or if you simply believe that He was a prophet or historical holy man, His death illustrates how a system of justice can fail to protect the innocent. The race dilemma facing our country is very sad and concerning at the same time. What have we become as a country where race appears to be a weapon we continue to use to degrade others? We are completely divided by race when coming to politics. Want to share good news story, or do you have information that should see the light of day? Then we want to hear from you. Instagram ', 1),

In fact, Canada lets in just 300,000 immigrants a year; Australia 200,000. Other developed countries are significantly less popular destinations, but potential migrants amounting to around half the existing populations want to move to the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Spain. They too are going to be disappointed. In its most generous year, 2016, Germany let in a million immigrants, mostly Syrian refugees, but 80 million Germans are never going to let in the 42 million foreigners who also want to live there. Indeed, former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said bluntly last November that “Europe has done its part, and must send a very clear message: ‘we are not going to be able to continue to provide refuge and support.’” Clinton was mainly concerned about how anxiety about mass immigration has fuelled the rise of populism in Western countries. That’s hardly surprising, given how Donald Trump’s tight focus on the alleged criminal and job-stealing propensities of Latino immigrants won over enough formerly Democratic voters in the rust belt states to give him the presidency. It didn’t just work for Trump. It helped the Brexiteers win their anti-European Union referendum in the United Kingdom, it brought the populists to power in Italy, and it underpins Viktor Orban’s “soft dictatorship’’ in Hungary (even though Hungary has never let immigrants in, and they don’t want to go there anyway). But the fact is that the levels of immigration are not particularly high in the United States and most European countries at the moment. Net migration to the United Kingdom has been stable since 2010; in both the United States and in Germany (with the exception of 2016, in the latter case), net migration is down by half since 2000. Something more is needed to explain the level of anger in these countries. It is, of course, unemployment, which is much higher than the published (official) figures in every case, and is particularly high in the post-industrial areas that voted so heavily for Trump in the United States, for Brexit in Britain, and for ultra-nationalist parties in Germany. In the United States, according to Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute, 17.5 per cent of American men of prime working age (24-55) are not working. But unemployment will continue to rise, because it is increasingly being driven by automation. The rust belt went first, because assembly lines are the easiest thing in the world to automate, but now Amazon and its friends are destroying the retail jobs, and next to go are the driving jobs (self-driving vehicles). Automation is unstoppable, and the anger will continue to grow. So you can see why Hillary Clinton is concerned, but she seems unaware that the pressure of migration is also going to grow rapidly. According to the UN’s International Labour Organisation, there are currently 277 million migrants in the world (defined as people who have left their home countries in search of work, or to join their families, or to flee conflicts and persecution). How many more are still in their home countries but would like to leave? At least a billion, maybe two. More than half of Kenyans would immediately move to another country if they could, a 2017 survey by the US-based Pew Research Centre discovered. More than a third of Nigerians, Ghanaians and Senegalese are actually planning to emigrate in the next five years, according to the same survey. (Good luck with that!) Even a third of Chinese millionaires would like to emigrate (half if you include moving to Hong Kong as emigration). And all this is before climate change kicks the numbers into the stratosphere. The chief impact of global warming on human beings is going to be on the food supply, which will fall as the temperature rises. And the food shortages will not affect everybody equally: the supply will hold up in the temperate zone (the rich countries), but it will plummet in the tropical and sub-tropical countries where 70 per cent of the world’s people live. They will be desperate, and they will start to move. That’s when the pressure of migration will really take off, and the rich countries are simply not going to let the climate refugees in. Not only would it stress their food supply too, but the numbers seeking to get in would be so large—two or three times the resident population—that it would utterly transform the country’s character. So the borders will slam shut. It’s a myth that you cannot close borders. You can, if you’re willing to kill people. (Think of the Iron Curtain, which successfully divided all of Europe for 40 years.) And the rich countries will, in the end, be willing to kill people. • Gwynne Dyer is an independent journalist whose articles are published in 45 countries IT has taken a long time for the Government to begin to acknowledge what was evident from the beginning about the Dragon gas deal.

Looking on is Planning Minister Dr Bhoe Tewarie. ?Photo: CURTIS CHASE Trinidad and Tobago is now "a nation of ethnic minorities" with a decline in the percentages of both Indians and Africans and a 2.3 per cent increase in the mixed population. Minister of Planning and Development Dr Bhoe Tewarie revealed these statistics at the launch of the 2011 National Population and Housing Census Demographic Report at the Hyatt Regency, Port of Spain, yesterday. "The breakdown of statistics linked to ethnicity establishes clearly that Trinidad and Tobago is a nation of ethnic minorities with the two largest being Indians (35.4 per cent) and Africans (34.2 per cent). The group classified as mixed is 22.8 per cent and of these 7.7 per cent are what we refer to as douglas and 15.1 per cent are mixed but not Indian/African mix. All other ethnic groups totalled 1.4 per cent and 6.2 per cent of the population did not declare an ethnicity," Tewarie said. He added that in Tobago, 85.2 per cent of the population was of African descent with 8.5 per cent mixed and 2.54 per cent Indian. Commenting on the religious findings of the census, Tewarie said several religious organisations have experienced declines in their membership over the past ten years. "The largest religion in Trinidad and Tobago with 285,671 adherents is Catholicism. But this number represents a decline of 1.4 per cent. Other religions which experienced decreases include Hinduism and the Anglican Presbyterian/Congregational and Methodist Churches. "There are 240,100 declared Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago (decline of 4.3 per cent), Presbyterian/Congregational (decline of 10.2 per cent), Methodist (decline of 16.8 per cent). The religious denominations registering growth were Islam (1.6 per cent), Baptist (13.8 per cent), Jehovah''s Witness (8.4 per cent), Seventh Day Adventists (22.7 per cent). "But the Pentecostal/Evangelical/ Full Gospel denominations grew from 76,327 in year 2000 to 159,033 persons in year 2011 (an increase of 108.4 per cent), he noted. Tewarie also pointed out that 146,798 persons did not state their religion and 28,842 persons declared no religion, representing a total of 175,640 persons not affiliated to any religion. The census statistics revealed that just under 194,000 persons have some level of tertiary education. Those achieving up to primary school level education amounted to 29.8 per cent of the population, 43.5 per cent secondary level, 6.2 per cent tertiary (but not university) and 8.4 per cent university level education, bringing the total population exposed to some tertiary education to 14.6 per cent.

At the core of the diversification thrust is the expansion of business activity based on the development and strengthening of the SME sector. SMEs constitute the mainstay of economic activity outside of the country''s dominant energy sector and are therefore critical to the country''s economic and social development; playing an important role in employment and income generation, delivery of goods and services within the local economy and in export markets, entrepreneurship development, innovation of new products and processes, and as suppliers to large companies. This holds true for the SME sector in developed and developing economies alike. Notwithstanding Government''s recognition of the importance of SME activity, the sector''s continued development is contingent on the ability of the companies to compete in an increasingly liberalised and globalised trading arena. In this regard, technology, and specifically Information and Communication Technology (ICT), is critical to providing strategic competitive advantage. Various studies have clearly established the nexus between the widespread adoption of ICT and substantial growth in domestic production in developed market economies; acknowledging that ICT can play an important role in improving the competitiveness and productivity of businesses. The question arises, however, as to what extent have SMEs been able to reap such gains. A scan of key developing regions demonstrates that, by and large, SMEs have faced major challenges in adopting and utilising ICT. Data sourced from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC) shows that the sub optimal performance of SMEs in ICT uptake in the region is largely attributable to the following: Limitations at the levels of human resources, finances and access to information; taking cognisance of the imperative for SMEs to be extremely cautious in making investments in a scenario of scarce capital Difficulties in effecting changes to the internal processes of the enterprises and in their relations with suppliers, clients and partners, to take advantage of ICT; SMEs being particularly constrained in regard to the implementation of complex organization and information systems. In the case of the Asia-Pacific region, where SMEs constitute almost 95 per cent of enterprises within the region, data sourced from the United Nations Development Programme Asia- Pacific Development Information Programme (UNDP-APDIP) shows that while the region hosts the fastest growing ICT markets and ICT industries in the world, low adoption of ICT is a stark reality. This is due primarily to major constraints ranging from inadequacy of skilled technical capacities to inadequate connectivity and infrastructure, and very limited understanding of the dynamics of the digital economy. It is noteworthy that the scenario depicted above is not only confined to developing/advanced developing countries, as a relatively recent study conducted by Researchers at the University of London shows. The study, based on a survey of 378 SMEs in the south-east of England, found that the adoption and use of ICT mainly focused on routine operational matters, with very low uptake of allied adoptions of a more strategic nature, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). ICT was perceived by the SMEs to be costly and complex. With initiatives being taken at policy and programme levels in developing and developed countries to address the identified shortcomings, the race is indeed on to assist SMEs in maximising the use of ICT and ensuring that they contribute optimally to enhanced efficiency, productivity and market reach in the fiercely competitive international market environment. It is within this context that CARIRI is engaged in a collaborative venture with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in the area of ICT. With financial support from the IDB''s Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), CARIRI, as part of its mandate to build technological capability and enhance operational efficiency among SMEs, has undertaken a project to improve the performance of SMEs through the application of ICT. The project is targeted at companies in the Food and Beverage, and Plastics, Printing and Packaging sectors, which are among a number of key strategic sectors that have been earmarked by Government for priority attention. The project has four components, as follows: I. Sensitisation/Awareness Building Given the fact that many SMEs are not fully cognizant of the potential impacts of ICT, are confused by the terminology or see the technology as only applicable to larger companies, the first component of the project is designed to build awareness of the business benefits of ICT in SMEs II. Conduct of Diagnostic Scoping Studies This component will assess the current status of ICT use in SMEs and identify opportunities and challenges for SMEs in adopting ICT, and will include the selection of companies to participate in the third component, ie, the Intervention Programme III. Implementation of ICT Intervention Programme A major highlight of the project will be the interventionist approach which will be utilised, ie, directly hands on, working together with individual enterprises to leverage the full power of ICT. Accordingly, implementation of the Intervention Programme will involve the design and implementation of ICT solutions for 50 SMEs within the targeted sectors. IV. Measurement and Dissemination of Lessons Learned In order to maximise project benefits, results and lessons learned will be disseminated to participants at all stages of the project and will be available on a purpose-built website. In addition, this will help to promote the adaptation of the project to other viable business sectors in Trinidad and Tobago, and the wider Caribbean region. Both the Diagnostic Scoping Studies and ICT interventions will be undertaken at no cost to the companies, except for the acquisition of hardware and software items, as may be required. CARIRI sees the project as providing an excellent opportunity for SMEs to make a quantum leap in enhancing operational efficiency, productivity, competitiveness, innovation and profitability. Most recently, another sensitisation session for businesses was hosted in south Trinidad, at which Chamber director and CEO of Teleios Ltd, Ronald Hinds delivered a presentation entitled "ICT and SMEs: levelling the playing field." He encouraged the participants to embrace the use of ICT as a strategic tool that would enhance their efficiency and effectiveness. “I NEVER heard a thing.

I trust that all is well with you, and that you are ready to have a fantastic week. Sadly, my column today is not about anything too fantastic. On May 8, I experienced one of the worst online nightmares my email was compromised some say hacked and these letters went out supposedly from me saying that I was stranded in the Phillipines with my family after being mugged with a request for a loan from any and everyone in my contact list. Now, my contact list was long - or should that be huge So, I truly trust that no one was fleeced of their funds by these people. My phones rang out all morning from some people calling to ensure that I was okay, and I was able to receive e-mails alerting me. Those who are really close to me knew that I had not gone on any trip. One very dear young lady (another AP) who wanted to be on the safe side after going back and forth with these people who were claiming to be me, and after not getting me on the phone was about to walk out the door to send the money when I returned her call. She said to me that she recognised that some things were not adding up, so asked them to tell her something that she and I alone would know. These folks are so good at what they do, that they told her something to the effect that they were too stressed out to think straight. One thing they did not bargain for is that some of my people use AP more than/instead of Ava what they were using when corresponding with me, so that was a clue for some of my people that something was off there. Interestingly enough, a few folks, including readers, contacted me saying that they knew it was not me because these unsuspecting folks did not know that my writing style would be known and recognised. One reader had me laughing in spite of the circumstances, when she said to me that they used a lot of green verbs. Ah well. Hopefully they learned a lesson or two especially that crime does not pay ever. I know that there are enough people out there who are aware of these types of illegal activities to have known not to respond to these people. But what about those who do not, and could fall victim to the individuals who make crime their profession So is there anything that the victims of this online crime can do to recover from this I think of the people who could have lost much more than I would have (some very important messages and my entire contact list) like cash that they would have worked hard for What can be done to catch them in the act so to speak When this type of crime hits you suddenly, like it did with me, and yes, I will continue to call it crime because in addition to all the other inconveniences suffered, there is an invasion of privacy to some extent you reel mentally from the unexpected tasks that now have to be added to an already full list. I wondered as well if this would be considered as identity theft because after all they were pretending to be Ava and so I wonder, when in the world, with all the genius behind the internet, will somebody come up with a fool proof way to prevent this crime from happening. I know that everything takes time, bur pleeease somebody, do something. As usual, I did what I would recommend in this space all the time look for the lesson(s). So from now on, I have to create back up files of all the important things like business correspondence, phone numbers, dates. It is really a terrible thing that something that was created to make our lives simpler has to be messed up because of the greed of others, who prefer not to work legally. I hope and pray that lobbying of some kind will be started in serious to put a stop to this serious issue so prevalent on the internet. What has me in awe is the bravery() of these people to continue with this type of fraudulent activity always on the prowl for innocent victims. Thankfully, I have been able to retain the same email address for I really did not want to change it because so many people already have it. So let us walk on water because weak faith panics, growing faith prays and seasoned faith walks on water in the midst of the storms. TYF. Much love. “I NEVER heard a thing.

I logged on to the website of the Ministry of Planning and the Economy but have not found a concise statement on development plans. One has to look through speeches or articles by Ministers to get some idea of the plans, but these can be retracted or explained away in the context of the audience. Also in the case of planning, there has been a change of Minister. In a well-organised system, this would not mean a change in policy since it should be government policy and not that of the particular minister in post. I am assuming that this is the case and I shall refer to the Innovation Diamond first set out when Mary King was Minister of Planning. A recent letter to the Express (August 18) from Roy Mitchell also raises the question: "What about the ''Innovation Diamond''" Mary King, as Minister of Planning, arranged a number of public "panchayats" and the panel of speakers included University of the West Indies academics who supported, with examples, the concept of research leading to innovation of products with commercial potential. This development was in contrast to the traditional University process of publications in learned journals leading to enhanced reputation of the academics but no result in economic development of the country. In the January-March (2011) issue of the quarterly publication of the Trinidad and Tobago Coalition of Services Industries, then Minister of Planning Mary King set out in terms of a Innovation Diamond, a concept of the National Innovation System for Trinidad and Tobago (NISTT). The Innovation Diamond illustrates how theNISTT will operate and it consists of:1. Centres of Excellence (CoEs)which will focus on research and development (R&D) in areas that have potential for commercial exploitation and theCoEs will facilitate entrepreneurs with ideas for innovation;2. Finance which will be provided by Government (since the private sector is very risk averse) for R&D and venture capital;3. Test Marketing and Market development;4. Entrepreneurs, Small and Medium Enterprises, Corporate Expansionentrepreneurs leading the process;5. Organisationsnetworking of the various entities of the Diamond. The main purpose of theNISTT is to promote economic diversification through the promotion of R&D for innovation and to support the ideas of individuals and companies.NISTT is managed by a Council of Ministers chaired by the Prime Minister. Under this Council are the Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Council for Competitiveness and Innovation. Economic Development Board The Ministry of Planning and the Economy website states that theEDB "will reference and be guided by the seven pillars for sustainable development articulated in the Manifesto of the People''s Partnership and in particular, Pillar 4: Connecting Trinidad and Tobago and building the new economy, Pillar 5: A more diversified, knowledge intensive economy, and Pillar 6: Good Governance". The website, under this heading, further states that: "The Economic Development Board (EDB) was established to consult with stakeholders and play an advisory and implementation role in the strategic management of the economy. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago will foster a culture of research and innovation by allocating resources and providing incentives for research and development particularly in the non-energy and services sector. The target will be to increase R&D spending to at least three per cent of the GDP over the next ten years." In my articles in the Express of June 2 and June 9 on R&D, I referred to the poor state of R&D in Trinidad and Tobago and suggested that the present spending in that area was about 0.3 per centof GDP. I suggested further that it should be at leastone per centand that there should be a levy tax similar to the "Green" levy so that the private sector would also contribute to funding R&D. Council for Competitiveness and Innovation When the Council for Competitiveness and Innovation was established, it was chaired by DrBhoendradatt Tewarie, the present Minister of Planning and the Economy. There is no indication on the website of the appointment of a new chairman. The website states: "The council will assist in developing and implementing a holistic and competitive innovation policy that will transform the economy of Trinidad and Tobago and improve its global competitiveness and innovation rank over the next ten years." In her article referred to above, Mary King stated: "Our proposedCoEs will have a presence in our Tech Parks and ''bolted on'' to our local universities. TheCoEs will serve to incubate fledglingSMEs and foster technology transfer to the industry ensuring that all participants are aware of the value of Intellectual Property and its protection." It is clear from the above discussion that at the base of the diversification and economic development plans of the Government are research and innovation. Since the private sector does little funding of research in this country this means Government funding, even if the resources for such funding comes from a tax or levy on the private sector. Since the only institutions with substantial human resources for such research are the universities, an important issue is the mechanism for funding of such research and the ownership of the intellectual property rights resulting from such research. In my next article I shall discuss the issue of intellectual property as it pertains to funding of research in universities (and other institutions) with Government funds. This is particularly relevant in view of recent issues in Government funding of research on the pan. I shall not discuss the merits or demerits of the particular case since I do not have possession of the facts. However, I consider that such issues could be handled differently by Government and the university authorities so that any possible negative fallout could be avoided. “I NEVER heard a thing.

THE National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST), in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology, on Monday opened its 13th Caribbean Youth Science Forum at the Faculty of Engineering, University of the West Indies (UWI) St Augustine Campus. Running until today, the Forum has attracted over 180 students from a number of Caribbean countries as well as representation by Trinidad and Tobago scholars. The Caribbean Youth Science Forum is a platform for the nurturing of the passions of our young people through interaction with leading local and international scientists and professionals as well as through networking with your peers and science in action field trips. It affords delegates an in-depth look at the increasingly inter-disciplinary nature of sciences with a speaker list which promises a diverse range of topics for delegates to discuss, debate and learn about. The key note speaker this year is eminent neuroscientist Prof Miguel Noicolelis. Miguel Nicolelis is leading the WALK AGAIN PROJECT which witnessed the first kick of the 2014 FIFA World Cup being delivered by a Brazilian who is paralysed from the waist down. The teenager walked onto the field, leaned back a foot and swing at the football, using a mechanical exoskeleton controlled by the teens brain. In declaring the event opened Ms Ingrid Seerattan, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Science and Technology, stressed the importance of STEM education (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in building more diversified and competitive economies. It is important that we provide the environment to foster creativity and innovation as well as to inculcate a sense of entrepreneurship, especially in our young people. The Caribbean Youth Science Forum, therefore, provides our new generation of talented and ambitious young people with the skills and knowledge to enable them to formulate and implement solutions for many of our challenges. Seerattan implored participants to use science, technology to find solutions to some of our most dire national and regional issues such as in the areas of food and biotechnology, natural disasters, greening of the environment. “I NEVER heard a thing.

Thousands of dead sardines started washing up at Erin, Cedros, Palo Seco and Moruga at the end of May and continued into the first half of June. Baffled by the sudden fish kill, the Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) began investigating what caused it. The preliminary findings showed that the sardines were infected. Patricia Tobitt, the IMA''s chief information officer, told the Express, "Biological samples have been sent to an external laboratory for further histological tests and possible confirmation of this preliminary finding." Tests were also done on water quality and biological testing on the fish sample to try and identify what was behind the fish kill. "Both the water quality and biological analyses were then conducted at the IMA''s laboratories. Water quality tests included salinity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen and dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons. Biological testing included an examination of blood, organs and tissue of the fish," Tobitt said. Tobitt said the IMA''s field examination, laboratory analyses and review of the literature so far show that only the sardines appear to have been affected. She said that water quality tests did not show unusual levels of nutrients, dissolved oxygen or petroleum hydrocarbon levels that could have led to the death of the fish. “I NEVER heard a thing.

The school utilizes "personalized learning," an approach that uses software, data and constant monitoring of student progress to adapt teaching to each child''s strengths, weaknesses, interests and goals and enable them to master topics at their own speed. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON (AP) — In middle school, Junior Alvarado often struggled with multiplication and earned poor grades in math, so when he started his freshman year at Washington Leadership Academy, a charter high school in the nation''s capital, he fretted that he would lag behind. But his teachers used technology to identify his weak spots, customize a learning plan just for him and coach him through it. This past week, as Alvarado started sophomore geometry, he was more confident in his skills. "For me personalized learning is having classes set at your level," Alvarado, 15, said in between lessons. "They explain the problem step by step, it wouldn''t be as fast, it will be at your pace." As schools struggle to raise high school graduation rates and close the persistent achievement gap for minority and low-income students, many educators tout digital technology in the classroom as a way forward. But experts caution that this approach still needs more scrutiny and warn schools and parents against being overly reliant on computers. The use of technology in schools is part of a broader concept of personalized learning that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It''s a pedagogical philosophy centered on the interests and needs of each individual child as opposed to universal standards. Other features include flexible learning environments, customized education paths and letting students have a say in what and how they want to learn. Under the Obama administration, the Education Department poured $500 million into personalized learning programs in 68 school districts serving close to a half million students in 13 states plus the District of Columbia. Large organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have also invested heavily in digital tools and other student-centered practices. The International Association for K-12 Online Learning estimates that up to 10 percent of all America''s public schools have adopted some form of personalized learning. Rhode Island plans to spend $2 million to become the first state to make instruction in every one of its schools individualized. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also embraces personalized learning as part of her broader push for school choice. Supporters say the traditional education model, in which a teacher lectures at the blackboard and then tests all students at the same time, is obsolete and doesn''t reflect the modern world. "The economy needs kids who are creative problem solvers, who synthesize information, formulate and express a point of view," said Rhode Island Education Commissioner Ken Wagner. "That''s the model we are trying to move toward." At Washington Leadership Academy, educators rely on software and data to track student progress and adapt teaching to enable students to master topics at their own speed. This past week, sophomores used special computer programs to take diagnostic tests in math and reading, and teachers then used that data to develop individual learning plans. In English class, for example, students reading below grade level would be assigned the same books or articles as their peers, but complicated vocabulary in the text would be annotated on their screen. "The digital tool tells us: We have a problem to fix with these kids right here and we can do it right then and there; we don''t have to wait for the problem to come to us," said Joseph Webb, founding principal at the school, which opened last year. Webb, dressed in a green T-shirt reading "super school builder," greeted students Wednesday with high-fives, hugs and humor. "Red boxers are not part of our uniform!" he shouted to one student, who responded by pulling up his pants. The school serves some 200 predominantly African-American students from high-poverty and high-risk neighborhoods. Flags of prestigious universities hang from the ceiling and a "You are a leader" poster is taped to a classroom door. Based on a national assessment last year, the school ranked in the 96th percentile for improvement in math and in the 99th percentile in reading compared with schools whose students scored similarly at the beginning of the year. It was one of 10 schools to win a $10 million grant in a national competition aimed at reinventing American high schools that is funded by Lauren Powell Jobs, widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Naia McNatt, a lively 15-year-old who hopes to become "the African-American and female Bill Gates," remembers feeling so bored and unchallenged in fourth grade that she stopped doing homework and her grades slipped. At the academy, "I don''t get bored ''cause I guess I am pushed so much," said McNatt, a sophomore. "It makes you like you need to do more, you need to know more." In math class, McNatt quickly worked through quadratic equations on her laptop. When she finished, the system spitted out additional, more challenging problems. Her math teacher, Britney Wray, says that in her previous school she was torn between advanced learners and those who lagged significantly. She says often she wouldn''t know if a student was failing a specific unit until she started a new one. In comparison, the academy''s technology now gives Wray instant feedback on which students need help and where. "We like to see the problem and fix the problem immediately," she said. Still, most researchers say it is too early to tell if personalized learning works better than traditional teaching. A recent study by the Rand Corporation found that personalized learning produced modest improvements: a 3 percentile increase in math and a smaller, statistically insignificant increase for reading compared with schools that used more traditional approaches. Some students also complained that collaboration with classmates suffered because everybody was working on a different task. "I would not advise for everybody to drop what they are doing and adopt personalized learning," said John Pane, a co-author of the report. "A more cautious approach is necessary." The new opportunities also pose new challenges. Pediatricians warn that too much screen time can come at the expense of face-to-face social interaction, hands-on exploration and physical activity. Some studies also have shown that students may learn better from books than from computer screens, while another found that keeping children away from computers for five days in a row improved their emotional intelligence. Some teachers are skeptical. Marla Kilfoyle, executive director of the Badass Teachers Association, an education advocacy group, agrees that technology has its merits, but insists that no computer or software should ever replace the personal touch, motivation and inspiration teachers give their students. "That interaction and that human element is very important when children learn," Kilfoyle said. “I NEVER heard a thing.

Genetics is multifaceted and misunderstood by many with the exception of those experts on the topic. It is also quite fascinating and controversial to those of us looking in, as she explained to writer Kimberly Wallace Castillo, while gving us a rare peek into her world. She graces our cover. The I AM WOMAN Project, a series which we have been carrying in this magazine, written by Lorraine Waldropt-Ferguson over the past several weeks culminates near Plymouth, Tobago this weekend with a triathlon. Waldropt-Ferguson is there to compete in the final leg of the aweseome challenge along with several other women. And despite the cuts and bruises she sustained a few weeks ago she has mended and is in fine form and ready for the challenge before her. Good luck, Lorraine. She will bring us her final report next week on what transpired. We now turn our focus from genetics and fitness challenges to yet another controversial topic and one which affects many women. It is the female orgasm or the “BIG O” as many like to call it. Some women have no problem having orgasms during their intimate sexual encounters, while others are ashamed to admit that they have never expereinced an orgasm. It was entertainer Nicki Minaj who inspired us to tackle this rather difficult issue after she touched on the subject in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan. In the interview Minaj appeared dismayed while speaking about one of her friends who had never experienced an orgasm. Something which she confessed was quite difficult for her to even imagine since she was of the view that it was every woman''s right to be sexually satisfied. Writer Nicole Farrell examines the topic on Pages 6 and 7. For opera lovers it''s a rare treat or will be when opera singer Maegan Pollonais takes to the stage to perform at the tenth anniversary of the T&T Opera Festival from Friday June 19 to the 28.

Last week parents across the nation were outraged that the SEA examination included what seemed like an unreasonably difficult mathematics question. Mathematics, of course, involves being able to use reason and logic, and the fact that so many adults had trouble finding the solution, logically means our nation has a serious problem— namely crazy SEA examiners. Hence I created this mathematics exam specially designed for the Trinbagonian brain. By which I mean you don’t have to hot your head if your numbers don’t add up. Take the test below : 1. General elections are coming up and Freddy wants to jail some of his political opponents. Freddy crafts law Y that lowers the standard of the burden of proof and empowers X number of state cronies to do his bidding. How many constitutional rights does Freddy’s Law intend to trample over? a. None - only you and people you like have constitutional rights. b. Only criminals care about constitutional rights. c. Enough to fill a Port of Spain skyrise. d. Freddy will probably cave in on opposition demands for key amendments just to annoy people in his own party who don’t like him. 2. Public official Denny calls his secretary Kate to his office to help him write a letter about the dangers of obesity. Denny then asks Kate to go on a date to which Kate responds “no”. Denny asks Kate the same question again, and Kate responds the same way again. This sequence continues for a further 20 times in a row. What is the amount of taxpayer money Kate wins in a sexual harassment lawsuit. a. At least one million doughnuts worth. b. Enough to go around Denny twice. c. From her perspective, not enough. d. Unknown amount as court documents are sealed on account that it would “gross people out”. 3. The distance to Tobago from Trinidad is 83km. The ferry the SS Bobol leaves the Port at Trinidad travelling at 40 knots to Tobago. How long will it take before it needs to be replaced with a similar multi million dollar ferry? a. Why Tobago people love to complain about everything? b. Some people don’t want to fix the seabridge crisis (if there was a crisis, which there is not). c. Before we ever find out who the local agents are at least. d. By next week. 4. Colin is doing a report on the economy. He learns that there has been 0.3 per cent growth from last year and a projection for zero per cent for this year. Colin writes in his report a growth of 1.8 per cent for last year and a projection of 1.9 per cent for this year. Why did he do this? a. Because it’s fake news. b. Because he couldn’t reach the real numbers on the top shelf. c. Because real maths is biased for Kamla. d. Because thanks to the Government education the public can’t solve SEA questions far less understand IMF statistics. 5. Nazma owns one building she wants to lease. She calculates she can receive x dollars each month in rent. If Nazma gets $1 million rent a month from a State enterprise, which cabinet minister is Nazma married to? a. Freddy b. Colin c. Denny d. He’s not listed as a shareholder so it doesn’t matter, okay! 6. Complete the following sentence: The square of the _________is equal to the sum of the _____ of the other two sides. a. State contract, bribe b. New fast Ferry, rocket ship to the moon c. All of the above 7. Name the principle which states: The upward buoyant force of a brutal dictator that is exerted on a body of a protesters immersed in bullets, whether fully or partially submerged while being water-boarded, is equal to the weight of natural gas that the body displaces and is pumped in the upward direction of T&T across the border from the centre of mass of the displaced people. a) Archemede’s principle b) The prime numbers principle c) Newton’s principles of motion d) The Keith principle 8. Trindad and Tobago has a forex shortage due to green goblins sneaking into the Treasury at night and using it to make paper planes, and not because we have an overvalued currency exchange which is leading to hoarding and those that can access large amounts of forex being able to profit from this by reselling large amounts on the black market. a. True b. Very true c.

AMID the murder and mayhem, an even darker threat emerged in Trinidad and Tobago during Holy Week. Last Wednesday, with suspicious sloppiness, the Telecommuni­cations Authority of Tri­nidad and Tobago (TATT) wrote to Central Broadcasting Services (CBS), parent company of Radio and TV Jaagriti, of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, led by secretary general Sat Maharaj, warning of a breach of its broadcast code. AN entire Lent passed the calypso season, and the leggo licence exploited by Cro Cro, at the steering wheel, when not at the microphone. AN innocent man died. He was murdered because He was framed and the system of justice failed Him. Whether you are Christian and celebrating the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday or if you simply believe that He was a prophet or historical holy man, His death illustrates how a system of justice can fail to protect the innocent. The race dilemma facing our country is very sad and concerning at the same time. What have we become as a country where race appears to be a weapon we continue to use to degrade others?

She has received both the Public Service Medal of Merit and the Chaconia Medal (Silver) for her inventions and contribution to the field of science and technology. She was also the winner in the Process category of the Prime Ministers Awards for Innovation and Invention in 2000 and, in 2002 and also received a special Award of Merit in the field of chemistry under that same awards programme. She holds in total eight patents for different commercially useful processes. A brilliant student of chemistry at universities in Canada, she returned home after graduation to work at the Caribbean Industrial Research Institute (CARIRI). She later moved to Lake Asphalt of Trinidad and Tobago (1978) Ltd, where she researched the properties of Trinidad asphalt and invented a range of coatings, paints and adhesives, which were marketed under the LASCO name. This was a major achievement, especially given the rathersparse laboratory facilities. From there, she went on to work as a materials scientist at the Dunlop Tire Corporation in New York for a short period before moving to Asphalt Products Trinidad Ltd as Research and Development Director. She is now involved with her own company DN Research Services Ltd. Based on her scientific research and development, Nicholas was awarded patents for processes to convert soft drink plastic bottles into usable products such as epoxy coatings, and to treat emulsions and effluents from the petroleum and petrochemical industry. With the latter technology, a very tight emulsion is separated into saleable crude that meets global standards for crude oil, clean sand and effluent water. Dolly Nicholas (ne Mungalsingh) was born in Gasparillo, Trinidad, and was one of nine children. Money was extremely tight in her family but her parents did not allow that to stand in their way; they made every possible sacrifice for their childrens education. In time, Dolly Nicholas and all of her siblings would make their way to university. She says her love for research and development stems from her love of the unknown. Her particular passion is to carry an idea from concept to commercialisation. A member of the Third World Organization for Women in Science and Scientists without Borders, she urges women to resist the notion of chemistry as a mans field and encourages girls to get involved in chemistry. For her part, she responds to every opportunity to facilitate innovation programmes that are designed to develop students capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation. In her spare time, Nicholas enjoys reading, chatting with friends over lunch or coffee, and doing volunteer work. Careers In Chemistry Chemists are scientists who study the composition, behaviour, structure and properties of matter.They reproduce and synthesise naturally occurring substances and create new artificial substances.

(82, ' Crime and statistics ', 'https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/crime-and-statistics/article_0b5dd4fb-d4e6-52f1-8e74-a2f5e2a559cf.html', 'Mar 6, 2017 ', 'Sometimes one is forced to ask what is the point behind the rush to read out statistics about crime. Especially when the motive seems to be to accentuate the positive. On Ash Wednesday, the police high command felt an obligation to tell the population there was an 11 per cent drop in serious crimes over the Carnival season. This, however, side by side with the fact that in at least two incidents, persons attacked police officers. In another incident, a retired member of the Defence Force was stabbed and killed. A deputy commissioner of police told reporters there were only 15 serious crimes committed over the Carnival period—that is between Friday and Tuesday night. He listed them as follows. Three shootings, three woundings, seven robberies, one stolen vehicle and one murder. That murder was the case in which the former soldier was stabbed to death during what was reported as an incident, which took place on Prince Street in Port of in Spain, on Carnival Monday. For the same period last year, we were told, there were 24 incidents classified as serious crimes. And then the deputy commissioner felt comfortable enough to tell us that there was not a single reported incident of a sexual offence against a woman. He was pleased, he said, about this. What was the source of this pleasure, he did not reveal. Perhaps he was fearful that for whatever reason, such occurrences may have been part of the story he was mandated to report, even if he kept his authoritative fingers crossed that his stats not include any repeat of the murder last year, of the Japanese pan and Carnival lover, whose body was found under a tree around the Queen''s Park Savannah on Ash Wednesday morning. Should we the people be comforted by the fact that there was this drop in serious crimes over the Carnival period Should we accept that it could have been worse The deputy commissioner did not say, but one is left to draw such a conclusion. Numbers are important, and the responsibility behind data-gathering is crucial, for a variety of reasons. A battle-weary, crime-news-saturated population would be encouraged to hope, however, that this reduction, from 24 serious crimes over a similar period of Carnival one year, to 15 in the next, might be the start of something. We might as well be thankful for small mercies. There were no reports of sexual assaults against women for Carnival. But in the same period it is reported that 13 women have been killed in the two months or so since the discovery of Shannon Banfield''s body upstairs a store in downtown Port of Spain. This sub-statistic includes the grisly murders by stabbing and chopping of an 87-year-old woman and her 51-year-old daughter in a fairly well-appointed neighbourhood in Siparia in the very period leading up to the Carnival weekend. They had a guard-dog which appeared to have been poisoned. Their home was relatively well fortified. Their community has been thrown into shock and trauma. The national statistic of a 15 per cent overall reduction in serious crimes would mean nothing to them. It will make no impression on their own sense of how depraved our society continues to become and it has increased their collective sense of fear, of dread and feelings of helplessness. Perhaps, therefore, the serious crimes-reduction report for Carnival has a purpose, but it cannot begin to provide any cover for the open wound that is the national profile we have been inhabiting for too long now. It will also make no sense whatever, to the residents in east Port of Spain who swear that there was wrong-doing by police officers who shot and killed a young man in a house in which his mother said she had expected him to be hand-cuffed and taken away. She reported the police saying they had a warrant for his arrest, but she caught sight of none such. Residents who gathered to converse with the police in the aftermath of this affair were reported as storming out of the meeting, when in their estimation the commissioner was less than impressive, in responding to their grief on display, and in their search for answers. We love the war, one angry woman shouted at the police brass in attendance. We could calm it down, but we could start it up, she felt bold enough to declare. Another resident said if justice was not forthcoming to their satisfaction, they would seek to exact their own. People feeling emboldened enough to shout such anger and resentment in the face of high-ranking crime fighters, including the Commissioner of Police, is itself a frightening feature of the menace facing us. This is taking a sledge-hammer to the already delicate, fragile edifice of trust Mr Williams has been seeking to build, among people in the communities in which this is most required. The prospects for hope, at least in the short-term, are beyond not looking good. The National Security Minister Stuart Young is also speaking up following the sensational se… “I NEVER heard a thing.

Lesbian, Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LBGT) activist Caleb Orozco and his United Belize Action Movement (UNIBAM) had in 2010 challenged the law claiming it contravened the country''s constitution of no interference with a person''s dignity and personal privacy, as well as equality and equal treatment of all persons before the law. In a statement on his Twitter account, Orozco said “we won on all counts. Speechless. “The Chief Justice of Belize. Kenneth Benjamin have found that Section 53 of the criminal code is unconstitutional and must be struck down” “He said sex extended to sexual orientation in our constitution, amplifying our rights,” Orozco tweeted. Belize has had the law in place since its days as a British colony and the President of the National Evangelical Association of Belize, Pastor Lance Lewis, in an immediate reaction, said Christians must now resist the coming changes to the society. ““We have come to the bottom. The only way out is up, and we will get up when we get down on our knees,” he said. Patrick Menzies of BelizeCan Patriots and the Alliance of Church Leaders and Ministers of Belize held the Belizean flag upside down, declaring that it was “all over” for Belize. The written judgement in the case was not immediately available but the Chief Justice said that the Court had an obligation to amend the law to bring it in conformity with the Constitution, and ordered an amendment specifying that the section does not apply to consenting sexual acts between adults of the same gender. In his new two hour ruling, Chief Justice Benjamin said the Court could consider, but could not act on majority and publicly held views, particularly religious views. He also said that removing the section would help accelerate the fight against HIV, especially among men who have sex with men (MSM), and who are stigmatized and thus refuse to participate in testing and treatment programmes.

What in the media is called a party of policemen was stopping traffic. We had made sure that our pass was prominently displayed and so had no fear of apprehension or apprehension of fear. A policeman stopped the grey car and then called another policeman and he called a third who carried more weight literally and metaphorically. Even though my pass was prominently displayed, they carried on a long conversation with the driver who, clearly had no pass visible. After some time, with us waiting impatiently for something to happen, either the grey car being pulled off the road to overtly receive a ticket or for the police to covertly conduct some kind of what the media refer to as an operation (essentially the removal of something from someone), the car drove off. We had already figured out that the driver of the grey car was a policeman without a pass and the others were debating with him what they should do until the heavyweight, recognising a batch (someone who was in the same group of recruits with him at the Barracks) decided to let him go on his way without let, hindrance or any reward or remuneration. This is Police Authority and Police Commission rolled into one. As we proceeded on our way I asked one of the policemen, Police referring to the driver of the grey car and he replied, Yes and may have been referring to himself. It seemed to me to be just another example that Trinidad is not just in a state but a police state at that.Two events were confirmation enough especially for those of us who already experienced our baptism of fire on gridlock day and who see the daily cavalcade of police crimes (no misdemeanours here) in the media. I did a quick Google search using the terms Trinidad, police and charged and got 972,000 results including Twelve cops charged, Cop jailed, Cop on shooting charge, Female cop charged with robbery, beating, Police officer charged with shooting with intent, Police officer denied bail, Seven TT police charged in triple murder, and so on and so forth, fifth up to the almost 1 million hits. Looking at some recent cases, the police may have inflicted more hits, in every sense, on citizens than Google found about them. The Government now has to pay $300,000 to a man who was wrongfully arrested, falsely imprisoned and maliciously prosecuted. Judge Joan Charles said the conduct of Assistant Superintendent Zamsheed Mohammed and Assistant Commissioner Fitzroy Fredericks amounted to a gross dereliction of their duty, and they were irresponsible and unprofessional The ball should be in the Commissioners court but since the Commissioner has no court and possibly no spheroid or ovoid objects that bounce, despite the spacious grounds he has for action, I am sure it will end up with the Police Service Commission and remain there forever. There are two issues here, one relevant to Trinidad leaders and managers as a whole and the other to the police. In the lexicon of T&T, OPM might stand for the Office of the Prime Minister but where it is most displayed or apparent is in the way we deal with Other Peoples Money. Superintendent Mohammed and Assistant Commissioner Fredericks dont have to pay a cent. Police beat people, damage them physically and mentally, but the fines are paid by the Government. So long as this continues, the police treatment of citizens will get worse. The other thing is the sign I saw that says, Buys Copper. Clearly he is not the only one who buys coppers. The question is, are they worth the price we pay GOVERNMENT’S decision to re­gister Venezuelan migrants from May 31 to June 14 will allow more Venezuelans to work legally in T&T. Potheads have for decades celebrated their love of marijuana on April 20, but the once counter-culture celebration that was all about getting stoned now is so mainstream Corporate America is starting to embrace it.

Chief Justice Ivor Archie on Friday said the Judiciary is proposing a permanent body of Government Ministers and top level members of the Judiciary to deal with issues of concern within the system. One of the issues specially targeted he said, was the backlog of cases before the nation''s courts. Archie made the disclosure during the launch of a video conferencing project, at the Coco Reef Hotel at Crown Point, Tobago, that will allow prisoners to be remanded via video conferencing between the courts and the prisons. He said the project was the result of collaborative efforts between the Judiciary, the Police Service and the Prisons Service, adding that this was the type of collaboration needed in order to move forward in transforming the administration of justice. He outlined several successes the Judiciary has had from its own initiatives over the years, including the application of modern information technology in the courtrooms, the training of judicial officers and the establishment of customer service outlets at all court locations. "Our successes in these areas have reinforced our belief that within the Judiciary there is the competence, commitment and, given the right resources, the capacity for enabling and accomplishing the necessary reforms in the administration of justice," he said. "We know this issue of the sizeable backlog of cases before the courts of the country is one of great public concern, and we owe it to the national community to correct what we know has been, for too long, an unacceptable, albeit unavoidable situation," he said.

But they also believe that homosexuality is wrong. "We don''t believe that any human being should be discriminated against," says Pundit Uttam Maharaj, the President-General and Dharmacharya of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha. "But we are not for same-sex marriage, because we don''t have a system for that in sanatan dharma." Mirza Ali-Mohammed, who is imam of the Bamboo Mosque in Valsayn, says, "No one should be discriminated against in T&T, regardless of any factors." He emphasised, however, that "Islam views homosexuality as contrary to human nature and unnatural. In fact, Islam views it as morally repugnant." Pastor Amresh Semurath, of the Reformed Evangelical Church in Tunapuna, says, "I don''t believe a person should be discriminated against. But, in the religious realm, a person must meet certain standards." (Box 1 cites the religious texts from the Bible, Quran, and Manusamhita which declare homosexuality to be immoral.) Earlier this month, Roman Catholic Archbishop Joseph Harris emphasised the RC church''s opposition to same-sex marriage. "If we facilitate sinful structures, which are against God''s law, we are teaching our young people that it''s okay to lead a sinful life. We must turn back to God," Harris said in an interview with the Trinidad Guardian (June 11). Ali-Mohammed similarly believes that tolerance of homosexuality would have dire social consequences. "Homosexual intercourse inherently is an unhealthy act and carries higher risks of sexually transmitted infections. Decriminalising homosexuality therefore will facilitate acts which threaten public health," he said in an e-mail response to questions from the Sunday Express, adding, "I believe that decriminalising anything, including homosexuality, would encourage experimentationespecially among the youthand the fear is that this ''alternative lifestyle'' may appear to be acceptable." Pastor Semurath disagrees. "I don''t think it will change the society one way or the other, because homosexuality is going on at present," he says. His concern is whether decriminalisation would lead to information about homosexuality being disseminated, especially in schools. "There is an agenda on the other side, that they must be free to teach their position. I don''t believe the State should allow teaching about homosexuality as a lifestyle," he said in a telephone interview. Pundit Maharaj also does not believe that the society would be significantly changed if sexual orientation was made a legal ground to claim discrimination. "As it is, people are operating right now and nobody declares who he is. People will continue to voice their opinions," he said. Ali-Mohammed''s view that acceptance of homosexuals results in an increase in homosexuality is not supported by current research. Neuroscientist Simon LeVay, in his book Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why, writes: "It seems fair to conclude from these and other studies that people''s basic sexual orientation doesn''t commonly undergo major shifts...there is no a priori reason to conclude that social processes help decide whether a person becomes gay or straight, simply by virtue of the fact that a many-year gap exists between birth and the awakening of same-sex or opposite-sex desire." There is also no data showing that decriminalising homosexuality has resulted, in the societies which have done so, in an increase in the percentage of gays over time, since the ratio has held steady at about two to four per cent of any given population. Archbishop Harris''s assertion that acceptance of homosexuality would lead to a more sinful life is also not borne out by evidence. Murder is generally viewed as the ultimate wrong-doing in both religious and secular moral systems. Additionally, homicide rates in societies generally correlate with other kinds of crime. If Harris''s claim is correct, then societies where homosexuality is legal or widely accepted should have higher homicide rates than those which do not; but, as Table 1 shows, this is not the case. The table lists the seven countries with the highest levels of tolerance for homosexuality, plus Trinidad and Tobago. All seven have low homicide rates and low corruption levels. T&T, where sodomy is a criminal act and where the Equal Opportunities Act (EOA) specifically excludes sexual orientation as a basis for battling discrimination, is both highly murderous and highly corrupt. Homosexuality has been decriminalised in 120 countries, and is illegal in about 80. Most of the latter countries are in the Caribbean, Africa, and the Islamic regions. Homosexuality carries the death penalty in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, parts of Nigeria and Somalia, and in Iran. There are only nine countries which have no official heterosexist discrimination: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, and Spain. These countries allow gays to marry and to adopt children. Political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Christian Welzel, using data from the World Values Survey, write in their book Modernisation, Cultural Change, and Democracy that: "At the social level, we find a highly significant relationship between levels of tolerance and life satisfaction. This does not mean that people are more satisfied with their lives because they themselves are relatively tolerant of homosexuals. Instead, societies in which tolerance is widespread have a friendlier social climate that affects all members of that society." In the United States, decriminalisation of homosexuality started in 1969, and in 2003 the US Supreme Court passed a judgement which declared that all anti-sodomy laws were unconstitutional. (See Box 2.) Public opinion polls in the US show that, in the 1970s, over 75 per cent of Americans still considered homosexuality to be morally wrong and opposed its legalisation, but even then less than half said gays should not have the same rights as heterosexuals. By 2010, although a majority still held to the "morally wrong" view, that percentage had fallen, and only 15 per cent still believed that gays should be denied equal opportunities. "Liberals are more accepting of homosexuality than conservatives, white more accepting than blacks, and the secular more tolerant than the religious," writes scholar Steven Pinker in his book The Better Angels of our Nature. In T&T, the Draft Gender Policy, which is supposed to be laid in Parliament soon, included a recommendation that laws which discriminate against gays should be removed from the country''s statute books. But the Government Minister who was championing that cause, Verna St Rose Greaves, was removed from Cabinet by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar in last Friday''s reshuffle. Ali-Mohammed does not agree that the EOA should be amended to include sexual orientation, since he argues that gay people already have legal recourse if they should be discriminated against. "As far as I am aware, a person is free to seek redress in the legal system for any form of discrimination," he says. "A person or group can also speak out if they are subjected to any discriminationusing the media. We enjoy that freedom in T&T." Asked if Hindus would object if the EOA was amended, Pundit Maharaj reiterated, "We believe that every human being should be respected. If a homosexual person has a skill, they should not be denied." And Pastor Semurath says, "If a person is homosexual, they should not be denied a job or a service because of that. Nobody denies an adulterer a job, but that is also a sin."

And some people have even questioned whether the human-like figure with wooden stakes in the back and leg was linked to black magic. Pundit Khemraj Vyas, secretary of the pundit parishad (Council of Pundits), said a murti of the Hindu God is often fashioned out of clay and ceremonies are performed. Vyas said the murtis are usually broken up and immersed in a water source to symbolically “wash away difficulties”. He said, “I don''t think it is a murti from the Hindu observance. These murtis are made from clay and is biodegradable. And all efforts are made to break it up into pieces. It is hardly likely that these are murtis from the festival.” Vyas said several murtis were submerged in beaches along the east coast and none had washed ashore. He said although concrete was used to build murtis for temples and homes, those being immersed in water were made solely of clay. Another pundit, Balmesh Sieunarine, said he viewed the photographs and was convinced that the statues were not from the Hindu festival. “The murtis we use are made from clay and I saw the sticks in the back and leg and it is not a Hindu murti. That looks like black magic. It is definitely not a murti,” he said, The statues made of straw, clay and concrete washed ashore on a north coast beach on Sunday, frightening some bathers.

It is unfortunate that religious leaders can only promote religion through condemnation of women since the time of Eve (May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon her). Condemnation is the methodology of appearing to be religious and women are easy targets because of Eve. There is no condemnation of the males particularly of the calypsonians, the soca and chutney artistes, many of whom make sexually suggestive gestures and lyrics in their performances. The absence of shame in the abominable moral and ethical behaviour of masqueraders is in fact, due to the failure of the “Church” to inculcate moral and spiritual values in our citizenry. These teachings are confined within the walls of the church where the rich collection of tithes promotes the heavenly reward of their contributors. There is no effort by any denomination to reach out to the general public to promote moral and spiritual values and inculcate a sense of shame. This failure by the “Church” is the genesis of the crimes which we encounter on a daily basis. Carnival has its roots in the Church, and this is why it is the precursor to Ash Wednesday. The Church has been negligent in overseeing the conduct of a festival which it introduced to our people and which has now grown out of its hands. It is my firm belief that if anyone is to be blamed for the decadence of moral behaviour and the absence of shame in Carnival; it is the leaders of the Church, all of whom seem to be men.

The latest instalment comes from Joan Yuille Williams, the People''s National Movement (PNM) lady vice- chairman and close associate of Manning who advised the nation that it should not blame the late prime minister for the outcome of the 2010 election, notwithstanding all that has been said about that outcome by his critics and detractors. In a sense, Joan is right. The event was many sided and possibly required complex explanations. One explanation is that Manning called the election early at a time when the country was seething with unrest, and he was extremely unpopular and had lost a big chunk of his base and much of the floating vote. My own feeling is that the religious factor and the prophetess were also more important than most of us realised. Manning, a fundamentalist reader of the Old Testament, had openly claimed that he was God''s chosen instrument. Many, including this author, did not take him seriously when he told us that God would determine the outcome, not the polls or the media. Manning said he was “drunk” but that he was “drunk” on “God”. Love changes everything. He could not lose. Former Anglican Bishop Calvin Best, told us on the day of Manning''s burial that he had a world view which explains his behaviour. Manning was not hubristic, arrogant, or pompous. He saw himself as a servant of God who was his inspiration. He felt that God was within him, protecting him with his rod and staff, even as he walked through the shadow of the valley of political death. The problem may however have been that Manning, who read the Bible literally, had a different eye from that of those who had the vote. In his mind, he could not fail. Yuille-Williams had a different explanation. She herself tells us on August 12 at a 40-day remembrance day at SAPA that Manning was a democrat. He gave voters a choice, and they made it in keeping with their own reading of the facts. Manning, according to Yuille-Williams, let the voters choose. He was not foolish. He was the ultimate democrat. He believed that God would lead voters to make the correct choice and give him the mandate, just as ANR Robinson had chosen him after the 18-18 election tie. But the “mandate of heaven” had passed to others who also claimed that they would “rise”. Two narratives were thus on the bench of history. Did Manning read the wrong one The issue is discussed further in my new book which would be available on September 13.

Donald Trump and Barack Obama met yesterday at the Oval Office in the White House to assure the American public of a smooth transition of government. Mutual respect and unity of country took precedence over the divisions of party politics—exemplary patriotic duty to country.” Obviously Mr Stone has an information blind spot. “Mutual respect and unity of country” was not the intention of the Republican Party when they set about their obstructionist tactics to make Barack Obama a one-term president. In continuing their obstructionist tactics into his second term hoping to taint his legacy, putting “governance of country before partisan politics” was not the Republican Party''s agenda but rather “precedence over the divisions of party politics”. I humbly suggest to Mr Stone to look across to his blind spot and he will see that Trinidad and Tobago has always had a peaceful transition of power albeit minus the hypocrisy of an Oval Office-type meeting. Fortunately Trinidad and Tobago has not attained that level of culture where hypocrisy is a refinement of high office.

THIRTEEN months later, and the result of the 2015 General Election is now official. The Peoples'' National Movement (PNM) won 23 seats to the United National Congress (UNC) 18 seats. There will be no by-election in five constituencies, since the Appeal Court this afternoon struck out the elections petitions filed by the UNC which was seeking to declare five seats null and void, thereby forcing a return to the polls. Judgment in the case was handed down by Chief Justice Ivor Archie in the Hall of Justice. Archie, and Justices of Appeal Allan Mendonca and Peter Jamadar, had heard the matter in the Hall of Justice, Port of Spain over three days, beginning on Monday. It brings to an end the matter, since in election cases, there can be no further appeal to the Privy Council in London. In an oral judgment which came about two hours after the final legal submission as made, Justice Archie said the Appeal Court had upheld the ruling of Justice Mira Dean Armorer who an August 19, dismissed the election petitions filed by the UNC which sought to declare the results in five constituencies null and void as a result decision of the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC) to extending the voting time by one hour, on September 7, last year. Justice Archie said that while the EBC did exceed its power by extending the voting time, it was not so outrageous a breach to declare the election result null and void. The judge said that the Appeal Court had to consider whether the election was held in a free and fair manner, and after reviewing hundreds of pages of evidence, the judges arrived at the unanimous decision that it was held in a free and fair manner despite the decision of the EBC to extend the voting time. Justice Archie also said that the UNC did not present any evidence to suggest that the extension of time was done to favour any political party. Justice Archie said that any amendment to the law to broaden the powers of the EBC should something similar happen in future, was a matter for the Parliament and not the Judiciary. Justice Archie also explained why the judgement was delivered today. He said the judges did not want to keep the population unsure about the legality of the election. A written judgement will follow, he said. In Justice Dean-Armorer''s August 19 ruling, she said: “I have, in these Petitions, strove to hold the balance to protect the will of the majority while ensuring that the patent mistakes have not reduced the election of 2015 to a mere sham. For reasons stated...it has been my view that the election of 2015 in Trinidad and Tobago were substantially in accordance with the prescribed law and it does not appear to me that the breaches affected the results. It is therefore my view and I hold that the Petition should be and is hereby dismissed". However, in her ruling Justice Dean-Armorer said that there was nothing in law that gave the EBC the power to extending the voting hours and that it acted unlawfully, and that the decision of election officers to extend the voting time past 6p.m. was not lawful. “Torrential rains and flooding on 7th September, 2015, may have impelled the EBC to issue the directive they did. Nonetheless, the uncontrollable weather conditions did not confer on the EBC the power to direct that the law be broken. The EBC, itself a creature of statute, ought at all times to abide by the clear dictates of the law and ought not to purport to dispense with those dictates even if faced with an apparently insurmountable problems. Accordingly, it is my view and I hold that the extension of the poll on the 7th September 2015 was illegal and election officers who failed to close the poll at 6p.m. acted in breach of Section 27(1) of the Election Rules”. However, the judge said that based on the overall conduct of the election, this was the only breach, and that based on the number of voters who cast their ballot between 6p.m. and 7p.m. It meant the outcome of the results would not have been different had the polls closed at 6p.m. The judge said that the breach was not committed out of malice but to accommodate the electorate due to an “act of God" (bad weather) over which the EBC had no control. The UNC had sought to declare the results in the constituencies of Toco/Sangre Grande, Tunapuna, St Joseph, San Fernando West and Moruga/ Tableland null and void since the EBC illegally granted an additional hour for voting in Trinidad on September 7, 2015. The Peoples'' National Movement won the seats and the general election with the margin of victory as follows - 1,633 votes (St Joseph); 3,615 (Tunapuna); 2,822 (La Horquetta/ Talparo); 533 (Moruga/ Tableland); 3,310 (San Fernando West) and 3,904 (Toco/ Sangre Grande). A sixth petition challenging the results in the La Horquetta/ Talparo constituency, was dismissed by the Appeal Court in May. There is no right of appeal to the Privy Council in election matters. The UNC petitioners were represented by Queen''s Counsel Timothy Straker, Persad-Bissessar,SC, Anand Ramlogan,SC, Kent Samlal, and Jayanti Lutchmedial.

Chinel Jeffrey sustained chop wounds to her back, hand, neck and head when she was attacked by her husband Christopher Singuineau. A police officer yesterday confirmed that the mother of four yesterday remained a patient at the Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mt Hope with ten or 11 chop wounds. Her husband was shot and killed by police who went to Enterprise Street, Chaguanas at 3.15 p.m. and heard loud screams for help coming from inside the house. They saw Jeffrey on the floor of the living room with Singuineau standing over her, chopping her. The officers called out to him to stop but he did not comply. Jeffrey was close to the door but was unable to open it. The officers broke down the door and entered. They fired shots at Singuineau. He and Jeffrey were taken to the Chaguanas District Health Facility where he died. Jeffrey was transferred to the Mt Hope hospital. ASP Smith commended the police officers involved. “It was the only way they could have dealt with that at the time,” he said. Smith said since 2017, there has been a greater presence of police officers and soldiers in Enterprise, Chaguanas and this has drastically reduced serious and violent crimes in the area.

Photos: Stephen Doobay Margot Tidd and her daughter Latoya. Photos: Stephen Doobay AT her home in Chaguanas, artist Margot Tidd is busy working on her latest painting. Its of a colonial style building one of Margots favourite subjects and while the outline is practically complete, she is still fussing with the sky making sure its perfect or at least close to perfection. For the first time, Margot and her daughter, Latoya Tidd, will host a joint exhibition at The Art Society of Trinidad and Tobago, beginning August 25. Its a momentous occasion for this mother/daughter duo. For one thing, Margot has been painting for more than 30 years, several of her pieces have been on display in the Caribbean and in America. As for Latoya, she grew up watching her mother sitting at her easel with paintbrush in hand and at the age of 14, she was introduced to watercolour, oils and gouache. Latoyas father also encouraged her to pursue her talent in art- taking her for drives to some of the most scenic locations along the western part of Trinidad and to exhibitions and art galleries. Both Latoya and her mother have exhibited their work before but never together, until now. The Tidds invited Woman to their residence where we got a look at some of the 50 pieces that will be on display at their exhibition. That includes some of Margots oldest art work which goes as far back as the early 90s. Margots creative gene was passed on to both Latoya and her brother Sherlon although he is more inclined towards the marketing aspect of art. Margots style of painting has its own distinctiveness. Her work, mostly done with acrylics, reflects her fascination with horses and historical and architectural landscapes. For her part, Latoya loves painting seascapes, her favourite medium is oils, although she has been known to experiment with other materials including nail polish on a few of her paintings. Latoya also likes to work with different surfaces, for instance, her seascape, Toco-What a beautiful place was painted on a tree stump. The upcoming exhibition titled Retrospect. A journey through the past carries two themes; preservation and conservation. Preservation in terms of preserving things that we all understood growing up as children, preserving our history, historical landmarks and the environment and healthy living. And conservation of the environment and natural resources,explains Latoya. We want that when people view our paintings- it takes them back in time. Margot documents historical landmarks through her paintings. We should treasure these places, not throw them down,she says, referring to the colonial-style gingerbread houses which feature in many of her pieces. Meanwhile, Latoya hopes that her paintings will remind people of the beauty that exists right here in Trinidad and Tobago. For the past 11 years, she has been teaching art at St Josephs College, hoping to instill the same passion she has for art in the minds of her pupils. We need to embrace it and help the young ones appreciate it. They have to treasure the different aspects of our land and remember what is truly important,says Latoya.

COLLAPSE: A house on the Manzanilla-Mayaro Road which suffered the worst damage following the floods. Port of Spain had no concert hall until 1959 when Queen''s Hall was built on the edge of St. Ann''s. Pressure for the building of a concert hall was led by the redoubtable Mrs Helen May Johnstone, universally called Ma John, by all of those who knew her. In 1948, the newly-formed Trinidad Music Association (TMA) put on the first Trinidad and Tobago Music Festival. Ma John was the driving force behind the TMA and there was a strong synergy between the establishment of the Music Festival and the pressure for a concert hall. Prior to the building of the Queen''s Hall, Roxy Theatre in St James was the venue for the Music Festival, as it was for many other events that required the use of a theatre/concert hall. Roxy of course, was a cinema, not a theatre, but in Trini parlance, cinemas were always known as theatres. I am familiar with the Roxy and Queen''s Hall venues because Auntie Lorna, who was among the founding members of the TMA and the Honorary Secretary of it for many years, regularly took me there. I have previously recounted seeing Geoffrey Holder and the renowned Louise Bennett perform at the West Indian Arts Festival, at Roxy, in celebration of the Federation in 1958, and Auntie Lorna wanting to leave one of the performances because, in the course of one of his dances, Geoffrey Holder hung a hat he was wearing on a cross. How times have changed. I once "performed" at Queen''s Hall, winning the Independence Youth Speaking Competition, as part of a formidable field that included a future colleague. I mention this to exemplify how fate works. For the final of the Youth Speaking Competition, contestants had to prepare five topics, not knowing until a draw made half an hour before the start of competition, which of the five topics would actually be the contestant''s competition piece. One of the topics was on culture and I drew it. Fortunately for me my childhood and teenage association with Ma John and her brigade had infused my preparation. Naparima Bowl was opened in 1962. Ma John and her successors radiated their energies South so that the Music Festival developed a southern arm and a similar synergy between the Music Festival and the need for a concert hall/theatre in the South also developed and had a positive result. The then PNM Ministry of Education and Culture, particularly Mr Donald Pierre, when he was in office, was receptive to the cultural lobbyists. This was a time when the PNM was popular and populist, and not yet in the grip of greedy elements. The constructive vision of a political party can probably survive the malignant influence of one or two Johnny O''s, but control cannot be ceded to such characters; but let me not digress. According to an article by Judy Raymond published in the Express on October 28, 1990, on the occasion of the re-opening of the Naparima Bowl, 13 years after it was destroyed by fire, the new Naparima Bowl was re-built at a cost of $10.8 million and was well received by the creative arts community of San Fernando and environs. No account of the creation and development of cultural space could be valid without reference to Beryl McBurnie, her Little Carib Company and its dedicated band of influential supporters, among whose numbers was Sir Hugh Wooding, our first Chief Justice at Independence. It is also important to acknowledge that Beryl McBurnie''s influence was not simply the promotion of dance and theatre. She was a powerful agitator against discrimination in the performing arts. It is difficult to understand why current efforts to fix the Little Carib Theatre, on White Street, Woodbrook, are not receiving timely support from the Government and the private sector. It is a statement of the obvious to say that the provision of cultural space in Trinidad and Tobago cannot be confined to sites for the performing arts executed on stages, usually located indoors. Artistic expression in our country is firmly located in streets and yards. This expression is mainstream. I accept that the founders of the Carnival Development Committee fully recognised the need to provide a venue for Carnival and pan. However, no one with the political power to provide better for this form of artistic expression has since reviewed the use of streets and yards, as the requirements for Carnival and pan space grew. We are in fact using the same routes and less facilities even though the size of a band of masqueraders has double and trebled in each category and the logistics and movement of the largest bands are akin to a military operation. As readers will have guessed, this column is a prelude to some comments on the newly-minted National Academy for the Performing Arts and the problem of fete space to which I will come next week.

Racking up a play count of an amazing 417 times on the road Carnival Monday and Tuesday, "Palance" beat defending Road March queen, Fay-Ann Lyons whose "True Lies" came in second with just 40 plays. Machel Montano took third place with his "No Behaviour," which garnered only 11 plays. JW and Blaze convincingly also won the International Soca Monarch title on Carnival Friday becoming the first duo act to do so. In the way of airplay "Palance" enjoyed a platform other Road March winners did not as the song received heavy rotation on at least ten radio stations, free to air and cable television as well as over the internet on sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Toronto Lime and others. Of course there was some controversy over "Palance" as some soca artistes complained that with JW and Blaze being radio and television personalities the field of play was set in their favour as their song and accompanying video would receive as much airplay as they wished. Some artistes expressed the opinion that radio DJs and television VJs had no right singing soca. JW, Blaze and other radio and television personalities such as Shal Marshall, Supa Jigga TC and Akil "5-Star" Borneo who also perform soca and other forms of music defended themselves saying that it is everyone''s right to be a performing artiste if they so desire. "There is no degree or special training required to sing soca. If a person, whoever that may be, desires to sing soca there is nothing that can stop them," JW said when questioned about people''s objections to him and Blaze performing. The Birdie still flying In July 2010 news of the passing of the Mighty Sparrow rocked the world with people frantically sending emails, Facebook messages, texting and calling to find out whether the news was true. It all began when, during a show at NAPA titled Celebrating Our Calypso Monarchs 1939-1980 - T&T''s History Through the Eyes of Calypso, Sparrow had to be assisted onto the stage and performed seated. Midway through his presentation it seemed that Sparrow was in pain and ended his performance. The speculation began with people saying Sparrow was experiencing complications due to diabetes and that he was having heart problems. A couple weeks later while performing in Washington DC, Sparrow again had to stop in the midst of his performance. After being examined by doctors at the event, he was taken to hospital where he underwent surgery to treat an incarcerated right inguinal hernia. The Calypso King of the World has been doing well since although on the day fellow calypsonian Arrow died, a radio station got it wrong and announced that Sparrow had passed away, again sending fans around the world into a frenzy. Over the years rumours that Sparrow had died have circulated more than once prompting him to do calypsoes, such as "Sparrow Dead" and "Simpson", tongue-in-cheek style, but at this stage of his life such rumours are no longer a joking matter. New culture at Culture The most crucial development on the local cultural front during 2010 has to be the trouncing of the PNM by the People''s Partnership in May. How does this affect culture, you may be asking Well, one of the first actions taken by Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar was splitting the Ministry of Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs into separate entities. Thus was established the Ministry of The Arts and Multiculturalism headed by Minister Winston "Gypsy" Peters, former national calypso monarch. A stand-alone ministry for culture had been a longstanding dream of people in the cultural fraternity and having it run by one of their peers made it all that much better. Proving to be a mover and a shaker, Peters got off to a running start with one of his first actions being the freeing up of the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA). The PNM government seemed to have reserved NAPA for events hosted by then Prime Minister, Patrick Manning, UDeCott and members of Manning''s administration. Also only entertainment of a certain ilk seemed suited for NAPA and previous culture minister Marlene McDonald was reported to have said the facility was not built, "for those kinds of things" when approached by president of the National Chutney Foundation, Vijay Ramlal to access NAPA for a chutney music event. Under the stewardship of Peters, NAPA has served as the venue for diverse events including comedy shows, calypso concerts, a children''s rapso event, the hosting of a temporary museum displaying the skeleton of the T-Rex named Sue, a Divali ballet, pan events, the International Soca Awards and even a valedictorian function or two. Some people have raised the pre-election claim by the People''s Parliament that there were too many flaws, requiring some $80 million in repairs, for NAPA to be of any use. They wonder how is it the facility is now suitable to be utilised for so many events of such diversity, especially since there were no visible upgrades carried out on the facility. Back to the Savannah Possibly the most exciting cultural news in 2010 was the announcement of the return of the Parade of the Bands to the Big Stage at the Queen''s Park Savannah, Port of Spain, for Carnival 2011. This news was received with unanimous approval by all stakeholders of Carnival. The beloved North Stand will return to its original spot, while the temporary stand that replaced the Grand Stand will be moved opposite the North Stand and be expanded to accommodate more people. The Express was the first to break this news in August when Peters told us he had plans for an impressive structure to house Carnival at the Savannah in the long-term and temporary accommodations for the coming season. The National Carnival Commission is once again under the leadership of Kenny De Silva who previously served up to 2006. De Silva is spearheading the drive to return Carnival to the Savannah and to the people. At the time this review was being written the North Stand was already well on its way to completion. Staying with Carnival, history was made when radio personalities cum soca artistes, Jason "JW" Williams and Ancil "Blaze" Isaac released a song titled "Palance," which took the nation by storm as everybody from toddler to elder and priest to politician were palancing all over the place, singing the infectious hook and doing the aerobic-styled dance. Pan palang Minister Peters commented this year that there must be bacchanal in Carnival because that adds to the magic of the festival. Well, beyond the misgivings over soca-singing DJs there was some bacchanal in the National Panorama Championship of 2010. Under the governance of new president Keith Diaz, Pan Trinbago sought to breathe new life into the Panorama, which in recent years had seen a decline in attendance possibly because of the demolition of the Grand Stand and absence of the North Stand. Diaz decided that one way to generate more revenue from Panorama would be to charge a $60 entrance fee to the area of the Savannah referred to as the Drag. This is where the steel orchestras assemble as they make their way to the stage. The pannists usually go through their paces here doing practice runs of the tune and in some cases the arrangers tweak the arrangements one final time before facing the judges. Traditionally people gather on the Drag to listen to the bands rehearse and for years had been doing so free of charge. Supporters of the respective steel orchestras, many of whom assist in pushing the pan racks onto the stage also fill the Drag. In fact the Drag had become a mini Panorama in itself and was the place to pass through on the way into the stands or the place to lime if one were not going into the Panorama staging area. Diaz''s new $60 fee did not go down well with a lot of people, including some bands and their supporters. The steelbands had a problem with the fee because they felt it would affect the number of supporters accompanying them and assisting in getting them on stage. Others cried foul saying that Pan Trinbago was destroying a longstanding tradition that added to the excitement of Panorama. The Silver Stars Steel Orchestra won the 2010 National Panorama Championship retaining the title they captured for the first time ever the previous year. Playing "Battle Zone" composed by their arranger, Edwin Pouchet with lyrics by Alvin Daniell, the band scored 291 to beat Phase II Pan Groove, which scored 284 points, into second place. Phase II leader, Len "Boogsie" Sharpe was not happy and reacted angrily when the results were revealed. As November came to a close Peters incurred the wrath of the steelband fraternity when he, at an event titled Pan Relay in Laventille said, "I believe that Panorama is responsible for killing steelpan and I make no apologies for that." President of Pan Trinbago, Keith Diaz was enraged and with the support of his executive and the leadership of some steel orchestras declared war on the Minister and threatened to scrap the 2011 Panorama unless he publicly apologised for his pronouncement of the most important competition for the majority of pannists. Calypso capers After some three years singing one song at the Dimanche Gras to win the National Calypso Monarch title, calypsonians voted in November to return the two-song requirement from 2011. There will still, however, be only one song required in the preliminary and semi final rounds and the finalists will then perform two calypsoes at Dimanche Gras. This decision was a compromise of sorts as some calypsonians wanted to remain with one song, while others wanted to return to two songs. With one song up to the semi-final stage everyone was happy and the decision was finalised in early December after the calypsonians from Tobago cast their votes. A source in the Trinbago Unified Calypsonians Organisation (TUCO) told the Express that Peters also expressed his desire that the two-song rule be returned. The one-song rule served Kurt Allen well as he finally, after years knocking on the door and even leaving the arena for a while, won the title in 2010 with a convincing performance of "Too Bright". Setting the stage with props and actors to mirror Woodford Square and dressed as a vagrant, Allen sang that although the nation has been led by politicians boasting multiple degrees and all manner of academic achievements it is still in a mess. Allen sang that the economy is on a steady decline, crime is rampant, health care in a mess along with many other problems, while so-called intellectuals squabbled over ridiculous motions in Parliament. The former international soca monarch suggested that it was time for a vagrant to be voted in as prime minister, then maybe things would take a turn for the better. After serving as TUCO president for just over a year, Eric "Pink Panther" Taylor decided to contest the 2010 General Elections representing the People''s National Movement in the constituency of Toco/Sangre Grande but lost to Dr Rupert Griffith. Taylor did not officially resign as TUCO president and left the organisation in a state of limbo until the executive took the decision to install Lutalo "Brother Resistance" Masimba as president after Taylor gracefully bowed out officially. Beyonce bacchanal After Carnival was the big topic even before the season got on the way in 2010. TSTT announced it was presenting Beyonce in concert at the Queen''s Park Savannah on the Thursday following Carnival. Well, the Merry Monarch and segments of the culture fraternity were up in arms and launched protest accusing TSTT of trying to destroy local culture and prevent hard working Trinidadian promoters from earning a dollar. Show promoters cried fo', 1);

Here is a "Remember when" occasion that you will want to be a part of ... Locally grown bands like The Last Supper, Shandileer, TAXI and Imij & Company were an integral part of the social experience for many at a time when parties and concerts were made for dancing and self-expression. Many of the original vocalists and musicians from these bands will be coming from various parts of the world to perform in this one-time only concert & dance on December 1, at O2 Park in Chaguaramas. Also included will be performances by Imij and Company, as well as 2012 releases by TAXI specifically to mark this occasion. Listen to the MusicTAXI will be all-inclusive event at $750/ticket, catering to 1,000 patrons. Through this celebration, the members of the former TAXI wish to give back to the people of Trinidad & Tobago who supported them in their heyday. As a result, part proceeds from this event will go toward the development of local music programmes for differently-abled youth. The event will be a celebration of that musical era that spanned the 60s to the 90s making Listen to the Music a nostalgic journey for so many of us... he above introduction is the blurb that got us interested in doing this story. We felt we could not top that so we''ve left it pretty much as we got it.... Fast forward to Robin Imamshah, the everything man, the link between all the bands mentioned at the top of the page. On the day we visit, he is in his studio at Media 21, passing on industry tips and know how to up and coming persons in the recording industry. The bandbox neat studio with one large state of the art computer dominating the space is a far cry from the days when making music meant speaker boxes all over the place and endless lengths of electrical cords to be tripped over. Imamshah, who has a degree in music from the University of Toronto''s Royal Conservatory of Music is seated at the computer and if someone can be seated and at the same time pace up and down with nervous energy all the while not moving from his chair, then he is doing it. He is smiling because we have gone back, waaaay back to 1970 something and the days when some young St Mary''s College pupils who loved music got together to form a band called Last Supper...and the rest became history. To understand what Robin Imamshah represents is to take a tour through the musical landscape of Trinidad and Tobago. He talks excitedly about Sparrow, Lord Melody, Shorty and the contribution to the world. He talks about the celebration of our culture and the melding of the musical influences which he has always tried to represent in the music. The story of Imamshah and the bands with which he has been involved is a story of groundbreaking passages in our local music history or to put it another way the evolution of soca bands and their influence on the local music scene recording wise, and live performance. What bands do today, they are able to do in large part, because there was Last Supper, there was Shandileer, and later Taxi, setting an industry standard. Thankfully, there is footage available, carefully preserved by Timmy Mora (Video Associates), footage from the ''60s and ''70s of performances by these bands. These will run on a screen and form a backdrop to the live performances taking place on stage. Many of the names from these former aggregrations have become legends in their own right. Carl and Carol Jacobs of the original Shandileer, Carl "Beaver" Henderson from Last Supper come right up to now, Derek Patience, and all the other members whose names should be in a music hall of fame. Some have passed on like Brian Crooks who was the pilot of a plane that crashed in waters over St Vincent after a cricket match and more recently the legendary bass player Ancil "Perez" Forde. The story of these bands is also the story of the abundant talent that we take for granted here in T&T since the days of Lord Invader and "Rum and Coca Cola", so when we talk about soca going places and soca going abroad we either don''t know or remember that in 1979, perhaps our first groovy soca was a hit song called Sweet Soca Song (La la la ti ti ti sing a sweet soca song) composed by Imamshah and first recorded at KH Studios in Sea Lots. This was a government owned studio which came out of the then government''s desire to encourage a local recording industry. The song was heard by Alan Douglas, a visiting industry mogul from Casablanca Records. Douglas was based in Manhattan, so he had heard about soca, he was interested in the song and felt it would do well. Douglas also happened to be Donna Summer''s manager and this is how she ended up singing back-up on the single which climbed to 112 on the Billboard charts. Fast forward to the original Shandileer, which came to set an industry standard for how your average soca band would operate. They had contracts, they had salaries, they pioneered their own Carnival events at which they played, think Flygirls and Friends and those huge fetes promoted by Gary Dore. It was all good for a long while, but Imamshah muses, success breeds mash-up. So he left these shores in 1996 where he worked with a cruise line where he put to use his knowledge of music and technology. Much of this he says, is being put to use to put together the show. Imamshah now runs his own production and publishing studio called Studio 21 at Media 21 where he is in partnership with Peter Scoon who is Media 21. He is looking for young and promising talent to continue to put T&T''s music on the map.

Carnival in Tobago is the most significant event on the islands'' cultural and tourism calendar, with numerous cultural events running in the lead up to the street parade on Carnival Monday and Tuesday. It is said that if the islanders are not celebrating it, then they are preparing for it, while reminiscing about the past year''s festival. The heart of the musical celebration has been calypso; recently soca has replaced calypso as the most celebrated type of music. Costumes, stickfighting and limbo competitions are also important components of the festival. Carnival was created when West African slaves mimicked their French owners who where known for their lavish costumes balls. Forbidden to partake in these festivities and confined to their quarters, slaves combined elements from their own cultures to their master''s fete. Hence the creation of characters such as Jab Jab or Jab Molassie (Devils), Midnight Robbers, Imps, Lagahroo, Soucouyant, La Diablesse and Demons. Carnival had arrived with the French plantocracy and through satire, slaves formed their own parallel celebration called canboulay. Canboulay (from the French cannes brules, meaning burnt cane) and had played an important role in the celebration.The festival is also where calypso music through chantwells had taken its roots. Stick fighting and West African percussion music were banned in 1880, in response to the Canboulay Riots and British laws at the time. They were replaced by bamboo sticks beaten together, which were themselves banned in turn. In 1937 they reappeared, transformed as an orchestra of frying pans, dustbin lids and oil drums. The steelpan are now a major part of the music scene and are a popular section of the Canboulay music contests.

Nana, mama, maman, maji, madre, okaason or just plain mom. Whichever way you say it, its her day Mothers Day. The origins of the spring celebration are credited mostly to three women, according to the National Womens History Project. In 1872, Boston poet, pacifist and womens suffragist Julia Ward Howe established a special day for mothers and for peace not long after the bloody Franco-Prussian War. Earlier, in 1858, Anna Jarvis, a young Appalachian homemaker, organised Mothers Work Days to improve the sanitation and avert deaths from disease-bearing insects and seepage of polluted water. Jarvis died in 1905, on the second Sunday in May, and her daughter, also named Anna, decided to memorialise her mothers lifelong activism and began a campaign to set aside a special day. One thing is known for sure; the first Mothers Day was celebrated on May 9, 1914, after President Woodrow Wilson and Congress proclaimed the day as a public thank-you to all mothers. Since then, Moms role has changed. Few women worked outside the home in 1914 and none could vote. Today, working moms are in the majority and not only can mom vote, she has become a coveted political audience. A recent survey has found mothers are overworked, underpaid and yet are the glue that holds many households together. As to their work, whether it occurs outside the home or at home, mothers would command a hefty salary if they were paid, according to a 2013 survey of 6,000 mothers conducted by Salary.com. The survey took into consideration various tasks that moms do such as laundry and cooking (housekeepers earn an average US$10.10 per hour), overall management (a facilities manager earns an average US$31.59 per hour) and even psychology (psychologists earn an average US$38.03 per hour). Using these pay levels as guides, the survey found that stay-at-home moms should earn US$113,586 a year a 40-hours-per-week base salary totalling US$37,549, plus 54 hours of weekly overtime totalling US$76,037. Women with jobs outside the home would earn overtime for what they do when they get home. Families, too, have changed. In 2014, they dont always reflect the dad and mom and two children formula once so prevalent. There are blended families or households overseen by single or gay parents. And many grandparents are raising second families. Changes to families have resulted in mothers who come in all kinds of packages, said Karen Tongson, associate professor of English and gender studies at USC. The idea of motherhood no longer is attached to specific persons or bodies, said Tongson, who grew up with two parents but also maintained a close relationship to her grandmother, and still does. That role can and has been adopted by many who arent women, she said. Maybe we should be talking about the role of nurturer. Gender roles remain merely roles, she said. Mother can mean an older sibling, aunt or uncle. A nurturer is someone who feeds, holds and comforts, Tongson said. And it can take a wide range of competencies and skill sets. Observing Mothers Day is a custom Americans have grown used to and simply should be a day when people who want to can celebrate someone in their lives who has filled that place for them, she said. Stacy Hinkels resume includes experience as a sanitation engineer, soother, chef, housekeeper, disciplinarian, etiquette enforcer and nurse and that just covers one aspect of how she spends her time. She also is an exercise enthusiast, business owner and wife. But the one overall driving aspect of her life is her role as mother to two young children. Hinkel owns Fit4Mom in Long Beach, which offers fitness programs for moms, as well as facilitates the Long Beach Stroller Strides and Plum Moms Club. I try to help other moms connect and provide outlets for them to go to and enjoy themselves, Hinkel said. I also have stroller classes, running and walking programs and body back classes because todays moms need somewhere to go where they can be a mom and be themselves, too. One hundred years ago, electronic gizmos and gadgets didnt compete for the hours wedged into each day. In 2014, moms have to figure out how much television, computer, cellphone, social media and extracurricular activity time is appropriate. Its always been difficult being a mom, but today it is very hard. We live in an age of Pinterest and Facebook, where some people take on the persona of being perfect, while most of us are just harried, Hinkel said. Shared time together is very important to Hinkel. She remembers her first Mothers Day right after her now 3-year-old daughter was born. I thought it was a much more important day than my birthday, but now with two children, I celebrate all the little moments together, Hinkel said. I look at them and the people theyre becoming, and thats reward enough. sbsun.com The National Security Minister Stuart Young is also speaking up following the sensational se… “I NEVER heard a thing.

In fact, the opposite is the case: if children are learning, bad behaviour will become almost non-existent. The reason that most commentators have instead focused on the disruptive behaviour is simple: the reflex in this place is to turn to punitive and authoritarian measures to solve problems. Hence PNM leader Keith Rowley at a political meeting a few days after the incident said that "all of those girls in that video should face some serious disciplinary charges, so they will learn what they call a right is in fact a privilege, to go to a secondary school". The Trinidad and Tobago Unified Teachers Association, followed this tack of demonising children, cited as an example of pupil violence an incident where a five-year-old boy slapped a teacher. Teacher failure, in my view, is a better interpretation. But the following week, at a "Parenting in Education" consultation arranged by the Education Ministry, parents offered their usual solutions to all pedagogical problems: prayer and licks. According to one Gifford Fletcher, "We use other First World nations to model ourselves after and, if we observe, these First World nations are coming down." The fact that the average young person in a developed country has a higher IQ and is less violent than the average young person in Trinidad and Tobago makes no difference to Mr Fletcher''s uninformed opinions, of course. And so we encounter our first stumbling block to improving T&T''s education system: that we do have to draw from nations like Japan and Singapore and Finland, all of which had under-performing systems until their governments instituted deliberate and long-term reforms. It took less than 30 years for each of these countries to create top-rated education systems. Their pupils now regularly score in the upper percentiles on international tests in mathematics and science, and their populations have the highest levels of learning in the world. Disciplinary problems from pupils are infrequent and never disrupt the school. And it will no doubt shock the majority of adults in this place to learn that all this was achieved without licks or even sending delinquent teens to what Dr Rowley called "a different kind of school". Focusing on the needs of the pupils is a core principle of successful education. Indeed, the Education Ministry always cites "pupil-centred learning" as one of its buzz phrases, although it has not actually instituted any concrete measures to move beyond this pedagogical jargon. In Finland, for example, they do not have set classrooms for pupils. Instead, subjects are taught by modules, which allows students who are behind (or ahead) in a particular course to attend different modules so they can master a particular level before moving on. Teachers, moreover, do not primarily teach content, but teach students how to teach themselves. In Japan, they also put pupils at the centre in a different way. Every year, teams of teachers create a lesson plan to teach a specific component of a subject. The lesson plan is then taught to a sample class, and sometimes teachers from other schools will come to view the lesson. Afterward, the lesson is critiqued to see what worked and what didn''t, as measured by how well the pupils understood the subject matter. The lesson plan is then fine-tuned and tried again, and the process repeated until the teaching teams are satisfied they have an effective approach. Often, the method is written up in a monograph, which other teachers can buy or access. And nowhere in all this will you hear that standard Trini refrain that "some chirrun just cyar learn". But pupils-centred learning requires teachers who know how to do research, create curriculums, and structure the subject matter so it is just a little too difficult for most pupils: because, again contrary to conventional wisdom in this place, children learn best when challenged. Teachers in these societies are well-paid, have significant autonomy, and are highly respected for their professional knowledge. In this place, however, technocrats institute reforms without input from teachers, often based on some fashionable pedagogical theory that hasn''t actually been experimentally tested. Moreover, in their book The Teaching Gap, education researchers James W Stigler and James Hiebert point out that teaching is a cultural activity, which means that how teachers teach is determined by "a relatively small and tacit set of core beliefs about the nature of the subject, about how pupils learn, and about the role a teacher should play in the classroom". So, in a society where educated individuals assert that reading makes people civilised and in the next breath argue in favour of corporal and capital punishment, it is no wonder that the term "book learning" is an expression of contempt. And it is that attitude which explains why schoolchildren behave badly. —kevin.baldeosingh@zoho.com The National Security Minister Stuart Young is also speaking up following the sensational se… “I NEVER heard a thing.

Why they roam the hallways and misbehave. It''s because there are NO extra-curricular activities in most schools. Take for example, in all those prestigious schools like the convents and colleges they are full of extra-curricular activities like sports, art, music, drama clubs etc. Some people fail to realize and understand that not all students will succeed in academics. At my old school, a group of students were always on the hallways and being delinquent. One day a music teacher started a music program and those same students joined and was actually enjoying themselves and succeeding in something. The principal canceled the program and those same students were back on the hallways. Why would you cancel something that was doing more good than harm?. What is left for them to do now? Turn to a life of crime? This can prevented by giving these students something constructive to do instead of them wasting time. Idle minds turn to evil.

According to the annual disaster statistical review 2015, 376 naturally triggered disasters were registered in that year, up from a previous low of 330 in 2014. Additionally, the report noted that the increase in the number of natural disasters in 2015 was predominantly due to a larger number of climatological disasters: 45 compared with the 2005-2014 annual average of 32, an increase of 41 per cent. Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) such as those that exist within the Caribbean, are highly vulnerable to natural disasters where both man and the environment are at significant risk. Furthermore, climate change associated with global warming has further compounded the risk factor for SIDS.

Meteorologists attached to the Meteorological Service of Trinidad and Tobago, at Piarco, said yesterday Trinidad and Tobago should prepare for a rainy season that is wetter than normal and a hurricane season that might compare to that of 1990. At a press conference at Hyatt Regency, Port of Spain, to mark the launch of the hurricane season, the meteorologists said this country should also be prepared for the possibility of an intense tropical storm season. In 1990, Tropical Storm Fran passed over Trinidad, just weeks after the July 27 failed coup attempt by the Jamaat-al-Muslimeen. Just three days before the coup bid, on July 24, Tropical Storm Arthur had made landfall in Tobago, causing some damage. Meteorologist/climatologist Kenneth Kerr said the possibility existed this year for hurricanes and tropical storms to make landfall in T&T, with direct threats to Trinidad and Tobago from either of these weather patterns. He has called on citizens to be vigilant, take all announcements seriously and keep tabs on weather reports throughout the season. For those living in flood-prone areas, the news of a wetter season should be a clarion call to take all steps necessary to prevent damage to person and property. Higher than normal rainfall can be expected, in Trinidadin South North-East, South East-Central, South South-East, South Central, Southand Southern Tobago. Other areas are expected to be wetter than average, but the percentage is higher for the above-mentioned areas. The aftermath of flooding, storms and hurricanes is also a force to be reckoned with. In addition to huge sums in damage to infrastructure, the loss of crops and the loss of life, citizens must also be cautious of the proliferation of pests and water-borne diseases.

The red dot shows the approximate epicentre of the earthquake in relation to Trinidad. Trinidad was rattled by a magnitude 6.4 earthquake (preliminary data) Friday night, causing fear and unease among citizens concerned that it was intense enough to have caused damage, or trigger a tsunami. However, there were no immediate reports of damage, and no tsunami warning was issued. The earthquake was strong enough to cause disruption of the electricity supply, with T&TEC reporting issues at its sub stations in Carenage, Pt. Cumana and Santa Flora. The Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management issued a statement to advise citizens that it has put all first responder agencies on alert so that immediate assistance can be rendered if any adverse impact occurs. "Citizens are reminded to contact 511 if they have been adversely affected", the ODPM stated. According to the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre , at 10:10pm local time, an earthquake occurred north of the Paria Peninsula, Trinidad. The event was located at 10.86N 62.12W. The magnitude was 6.4 and depth 60km. Social media immediately lit up, with people sharing their experiences following the shake which lasted for a lengthy period and which occurred during the local government campaign meetings of the United National Congress in Debe, the Movement for Social Justice in Point Fortin and the Independent Liberal Party in Princes Town. Some reported pictures becoming dislodged from walls, and objects toppling from cupboards and cabinets. Others said they screamed and took cover under door frames. Many said they paused and prayed. The quake is the latest in a series, the last occurring on Monday 9th September, at 9:54am, west of Trinidad in the Gulf of Paria. The event was located at 10.25N and 61.75W.

However drastic it might have been, it is not as though we are unaccustomed to four to five months of intense heat during the dry season. Yet every year it''s the same cry that dams are running low and we must put away the hoses and run from the water police and have to endure water rationing. In addition, it seems as though it''s only during the dry season that WASA intensifies its leak repair programme. As we also saw, not two days into the rainy season, citizens were so badly affected that no less than the Prime Minister had to hike up her skirt and rush to flooded areas to deliver food, water and beds. Why must this be so? Why is it that during the dry season every year dams have to run so low and that materials and equipment are not sourced and provided for firefighters to extinguish blazes throughout the nation In fact, one of the spectacles this year was the visible burning of the Northern Range and the conversion ofsites like the Quinam woodlands into a scene from a horror movie. This annual distress of the environment must be stopped and here is an excellent opportunity to please Daphne Bartlett by having CEPEP assist with there-afforestation promised by the People''s Partnership... as soon as they are finished cleaning the beaches.Surely, this would constitute environmental value-added activity. I just hope citizens will maintain their discipline and not leave pipes running and wantonly use water hoses. Also, WASA must do its part by responding promptly to leak reports as well as not filling swimming pools with truck borne supplies. Remember, another dry season is just a few months away and just as we are relishing in the heaven-sent rainfall, very soon, we will be back to a parched and heated dry season.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) Smoke and flames from fire at the Hilton Sonoma Wine Country hotel in Santa Rosa, Calif., Monday, Oct. 9, 2017. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) — An onslaught of wildfires across a wide swath of Northern California broke out almost simultaneously then grew exponentially, swallowing up properties from wineries to trailer parks and tearing through both tiny rural towns and urban subdivisions. Authorities said that at least 10 people are dead, with 100 injured, and as many as 1,500 homes and businesses have been destroyed. All three figures were expected to surge in the coming days as more information is reported. Taken as a group, the fires are already among the deadliest in California history. Residents who gathered at emergency shelters and grocery stores said they were shocked by the speed and ferocity of the flames. They recalled all the possessions they had left behind and were lost. "All that good stuff, I''m never going to see it again," said Jeff Okrepkie, who fled his neighborhood in Santa Rosa knowing it was probably the last time he would see his home of the past five years standing. His worst fears were confirmed Monday, when a friend sent him a photo of what was left: a smoldering heap of burnt metal and debris. Some of the largest of the 14 blazes burning over a 200-mile region were in Napa and Sonoma counties, home to dozens of wineries that attract tourists from around the world. They sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) away. Sonoma County said it has received more than 100 missing-person reports as family and friends scramble to locate loved ones. The reports have come via calls to a hotline the county set up for the missing, according to Scott Alonso, communications director for Sonoma County. It''s possible that many or most of the missing are safe but simply can''t be reached because of the widespread loss of cell service and other communications. Much of the damage was in Santa Rosa, a far larger and more developed city than usually finds itself at the mercy of a wildfire. The city is home to 175,000 residents, including both the wine-country wealthy and the working class. The flames were unforgiving to both groups. Hundreds of homes of all sizes were leveled by flames so hot they melted the glass off of cars and turned aluminum wheels into liquid. Former San Francisco Giants pitcher Noah Lowry, who now runs an outdoor sporting goods store in Santa Rosa, was forced to flee in minutes along with his wife, two daughters, and a son just over 2 weeks old. "I can''t shake hearing people scream in terror as the flames barreled down on us," Lowry said. His family and another evacuating with them tried to take U.S. 101 to evacuate but found it blocked by flames, and had to take country roads to get to the family friends who took them in. A 90-mile (145-kilometer) stretch of the highway is framed by the flames and a major concern overnight, said Brad Alexander, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Highway 12, which winds through the heart of wine country, was also rendered unusable by the flames. "Sonoma and Napa counties have been hit very hard," Alexander said. The ferocity of the flames forced authorities to focus primarily on getting people out safely, even if it meant abandoning structures to the fire. Firefighters rushed to a state home for the severely disabled when flames reached one side of the center''s sprawling campus in the historic Sonoma County town of Glen Ellen. Crews got the more than 200 people from the threatened buildings, one firefighter said, as flames closed within a few dozen feet. Fires from ruptured gas lines dotted the smoky landscapes of blackened Santa Rosa hillsides. Fire trucks raced by smoldering roadside landscaping in search of higher priorities. The flames were fickle in some corners of the city. One hillside home remained unscathed while a dozen surrounding it were destroyed. Kim Hoe, a 33-year-old tech worker from Penang, Malaysia, was staying at the Hilton Sonoma Wine Country, which was gutted by flames. He said the power went out around 1 a.m., and he and his colleagues started packing up when someone knocked on the door and told them to run. "We just had to run and run. It was full of smoke. We could barely breathe," Hoe said. The large majority of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation, according to St. Joseph Health, which operates hospitals in the Santa Rosa area. Two were in critical condition and one was in serious condition. The number of injured is expected to climb as information comes in for all the other areas affected by the firestorm consuming the state. October has generally been the most destructive time of year for California wildfires. What was unusual Sunday, however, was to have so many fires take off at the same time. Other than the windy conditions that helped drive them all, there was no known connection between the fires, and no cause has been released for any of them. But the conditions late Monday and early Tuesday were calmer than they were 24 hours earlier, bringing hopes of progress against the flames. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the fire areas, and asked the federal government to do the same. Vice President Mike Pence, who is visiting California, said at an event near Sacramento that the federal government stands with California as it takes on the blazes, but he made no specific promises. To the south in Orange County, more than 5,000 homes were evacuated because of a fire in the Anaheim area. The blaze had grown to nearly 10 square miles and had destroyed 24 structures. ___ Knickmeyer reported from Sonoma, California.

(128, ' Caribbean Economies and Caribbean Economy ', 'https://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/local/caribbean-economies-and-caribbean-economy/article_adc39abc-c648-5246-99a2-a03e72889e1d.html', 'Aug 25, 2014 ', ' In 1995 during a short interview with 2050 Project Staff in Barbados, Professor Dennis Pantin shared his vision of the Caribbean by identifying the importance of the environment in influencing the livelihoods of Caribbean people, the need for integration of economics and eco-culture, the move away from cultural imperialism to one of cultural plurality and the need for political stability through governance by transparency, accountability and participation in decision-making. There have been many writers who have examined different theories addressing the problems of the Caribbean in the development debate; W Arthur Lewis Unlimited Supplies of Labour Model, Best and Levitts Plantation Economy and Dudley Seers Open Petroleum Economy Model. For Prof Pantin, although these models have contributed significantly to the analysis of Caribbean economies, he presented some critique or limitations of the models in their application to these economies. In the Plantation economy model, Best and Levitt took the position that in order to clearly understand Caribbean economies and its working it is important to examine our history. This view was supported by Pantin in his 2009 article Economies of the Caribbean, co-authored with Dr Marlene Attzs, in which Pantin and Attzs highlighted that an understanding of the history of the Caribbean is essential for an informed analysis of economic challenges current and projected. Pantin felt that the Plantation model was exaggerated in its implication that Caribbean economies had not realised much structural change since the 19th century, although many Caribbean countries have suffered from severe balance of payment problems and high inflation since 1975. The Model in itself has failed to specify the socio-political divisions created by the plantation economy through the five rules of game which governed the relationships between the metropole and the hinterlands. Additionally, the model was limited in its ability to anticipate resource shortages relative to the growing populations. In Pantins view there is a need to teach the plantation economy in a more central manner and for it to be further incorporated in the research agenda. In Pantins examination of how Caribbean economies ought to work, he highlighted the importance of industrial policy in order to achieve Caribbean Development and global competitiveness. This policy was one of the elements highlighted in Lewis 1950 strategy for economic development. Lewis model of Unlimited Supplies of Labour proposed a strategy for the industrial development of the British West Indies in which he saw it as essential for Caribbean countries to expand the capitalist sector in order to achieve economic growth and development. Sad to say though, we have taken too long to apply and implement Lewis strategy to our Caribbean economies. The challenges of the Caribbean have remained; finding mechanisms for regional collaboration and cooperation which affects our ability to deal with key economic issues such as unemployment, foreign debt and vulnerability to natural disasters. Whilst our context is one of small islandness and susceptibility to unexpected shocks of the world economy, there is a need to focus on domestic policies which are focused on protecting us from such shocks and ensuring that we optimise opportunities to generate income while being mindful of our current environment. Professor Dennis Pantins ideas will be the focus for discussion at COTE 2014 with the theme Addressing Contemporary Local and Regional Challenges for Sustainable Development. This conference is hosted by the Department of Economics, The UWI, St Augustine. Roxanne Brizan has an MSc in Economics (Distinction) and a BSc Economics with minor in International Relations.

Most of these requests come from known groups and much of what is donated goes to places like the orphanage in Tacarigua and such like. At least we hope that that is where these donations go. Certainly there is no way of knowing whether the recipient of your gift is the child whose eyes you wish to make brighter during this holiday season. There is also no way of knowing whether your gift may be better utilised elsewhere, perhaps, to a poor household or to a charity which is not close to an urban centre and does not benefit from the largesse of this giving season. Charity seems to have become part of the business of advertisement. The media carries many photographs of beaming employees of good corporate citizens, holding an over-sized cheque for the princely sum of $10,000 or so, standing next to a prize-winner. Free promotion and an increment of goodwill for a paltry sum. Who would not be tempted It reminds me of an episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians (I confess I do keep up with the Kardashians. The brain candy is addictive.) At that time, Kim was dating a famous and rich basketball player, called Reggie Bush who was from New Orleans. The Kardashians saw a wonderful photo-op and flew to the city to help promote Bush''s charity for the rebuilding and revival of the city. While the girls are having their salads at a restaurant (do they eat anything else), they are approached by a young black girl and her mother who had lost everything in the disaster. The camera dutifully shows the teenager expressing her love for the Kardashians who graciously accept her star-struck comments as if this was their due. The teenager excitedly takes them to the shelter where she and her family were then living. It was not a pretty sight. The scenes of despair, helplessness and squalor cannot be disguised. I realised that in my mind, I am starting to plug for this family, please, please, Kim, Khloe, Rob, please buy this family a home, pretty please, you can do it. Do you know what happened The rich people got together, had themselves filmed agreeing to buy furniture for the family, explaining to the girl and her mother, that when they got a home, they would be all set with new furniture. So the Kardashians got to show their charitable side and earn their salaries at the same time. “Tis the season for public chest-beating. Every day, every way, charitable donations and gifts are advertised. It is good business. The Australian actress, Nicole Kidman is quoted as saying, “What''s the point of doing something good if nobody''s watching” Maybe she meant it sarcastically, or perhaps it was a line from a film she had done. The sentiment which she expresses in the statement, is common in every sense of the word. On the other hand, Alexander Pope said, that we should do good by stealth and blush to find it fame. The addressee of millions of letters each Christmas, Santa Claus does exactly that. The message of these gifts from Santa is of more value that the material gift itself. So many people have lost their jobs over the last year that perhaps we should rethink the way we give. Instead of becoming awash with sentimentality while you and your children wrap gifts in bright red wrapping paper with ribbons to match, take your children to reach out to a poor family. Buy them the spare gas tank that they need, buy a mattress, a pair of pillows, a set of sheets, a ring stove, a pair of school shoes. Pay the school bus driver for a month so the parents will be able to avoid that extra financial burden for one month. Pay one month''s rent, buy groceries for a week, buy a desk for a child to do his homework. Dip your hands in your pockets. Make your contributions useful. I am not suggesting that your contributions should be large, give what you can afford, but also give something which will improve the quality of life of the recipient. This is the month we feel the greatest compassion for our fellow man so let our gifts count. A few years ago, realising that the established charities seldom reached remote areas, such as the village from which we came, my sister single-handedly started a project where she collected “gently-used” clothes for distribution according to need. The project grew at a phenomenal rate with people giving brand new, unused items and then other items such as wheelchairs. First Citizens Bank at the time gave an annual award to a person from the Caribbean who gave of themselves and of their time without payment or advertisement. The award was called the “Unsung Heroes” award and one year, she won it for Trinidad and Tobago. There are many unsung heroes in this country. Why don''t we join them “I keep asking myself whether a collective pathology exists. What is it in our mental make-up that has pushed us to create such great art forms as calypso, pan, Carnival, soca etc, which the world now acclaims—but then pushes us to abandon those cultural achievements, and instead import and elevate other people’s music as “superior?” “After 56 years, where is here…again?” my column, published on August 13, 2018.

Easter is a very sacred time of year for all members of the Christian faith here in T&T and around the world. The true message of Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ after He was given as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind. A study done on the stress of parents of children on the autism spectrum (Llias, Kartini et al, 2018), shows that parents with children on the spectrum experience significantly more stressors then parents with typically developing children. This nation and a large majority of its citizens are sick up to their necks with criminal tendencies, racism and downright evil intentions, which are reflected by the daily local reported events here.

Still, most foreign exchange investment in T&T is not really a function of lending rates locally as compared with US rates, but moreso on what export product/service export income this investment can produce. T&T is still in a recession and, according to the text books, interest rates should be increased to reduce consumer demand, to reduce demand for foreign exchange. “I keep asking myself whether a collective pathology exists.

The session hosted by CBI, featured presentations from Larry Romany, chief executive of CBI and Anthony Inglefield, managing director of IIOM. In October, 2013 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and CANOC Broadcasting Inc signed a first of its kind agreement which will transform the way the Caribbean can experience the broadcast of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. The broadcast rights for the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio have already been exclusively granted to CBI for 20 territories in the Caribbean region from Bermuda down to Suriname. The 2016 Games will be made available to FreeTo-Air regional television and radio stations, with 2,500 hours of Olympic coverage being available to regional sporting devotees during the 17 days of the Games, a statement said last weeek.The June 16 workshop, which was held at the Normandie Hotel, St Anns, introduced the regional advertising executives to the broadcast distribution and advertising sales model and outlined the opportunities for them and advertisers in their media markets television, radio, mobile and digital.Whereas the traditional model created advertising opportunities for mainly large local conglomerates or the local arms of major multinationals, this new model represents a significant shift, the statement said. Top tier sponsors can ensure regional visibility by having their advertisements embedded in a dedicated television feed produced by ESPN for the Caribbean and radio signals which will originate from Rio Smaller entities can choose advertising placements in the territories that matter to them, during events that showcase Caribbean athletes or during sports which we have not traditionally enjoyed live coverage of in the region, said Romany. Cable advertising presents significant opportunities for non-traditional advertisers. Regional advertising agencies can also benefit from the creation of advertising and content since many of the new advertisers will need quality advertising spots for the Caribbean Olympic feed, the statement from IOM said.Romany noted that this broadcast and advertising model can potentially impact how the world enjoys global sporting events in the future as it provides wider distribution and access to more advertisers who would not ordinarily have been able to participate previously.

Vendors at the Scarborough Market will be relocated to Shaw Park Complex by August. During the temporary relocation, the proposed upgrade to the Scarborough Market will take place at an estimated cost of $21 million within 18 months. This was announced on June 19 by Secretary of Food Production, Forestry and Fisheries Hayden Spencer during the post-Executive Council media briefing at the Administrative Complex, Calder Hall. Spencer said the division is now hiring a contractor to pave the designated area for the temporary market at Shaw Park. “The site is 90 per cent prepared, and it is just to be paved,” Spencer explained. “We are depending on Works [the Division of Infrastructure, Quarries and the Environment] to assist us.” Once the area is paved, the temporary market facility will be set up. “I was told it will take about two weeks, and then we will deal with the relocation of the vendors from the Scarborough Market to the new location.” New marine park policy coming There has been an increase in the number of accidents at the Buccoo Reef Marine Park. And Secretary of Food Production Forestry and Fisheries Hayden Spencer said policy changes are coming to address the issue. “We would have observed that a thriving Tobago business is developing there in the area of jet skiing, and we would have observed that a number incidents and accidents were transpiring down there,” Spencer stated. The secretary said his division had consulted stakeholders to come up with a policy for using jet skis in the area. The policy will minimise the dangers posed to beach bathers. “Some of the issues that we want to challenge is to reduce conflict, the conflict which occurs between the various users of the marine space, [and] to ensure also the preservation of the ecosystem in the marine park,” he added. Spencer said the protection of the marine area will ensure both citizens and visitors can enjoy the Buccoo Reef for years to come.

His time was 3:16:01, a personal best. The other Aqua Warriors who competed at the Championships were Abrisse Trim, Ezekiel Wilson, Yunique Wilson, and Djimon Wilson. The Championships ran from July 12-16 at the National Aquatic Centre in Balmain, Couva. The team was led by head coach Mosi Denoon. Food production a priority The 2017 edition of Tobago''s World Food Day will focus on training and building awareness. Secretary of Food Production, Forestry, and Fisheries Hayden Spencer said changes are coming to Tobago''s celebration of World Food Day in line with the division''s thrust towards food production, and because of a smaller budget. This means there won''t be a two-day exhibition as in previous years. The theme for World Food Day is “Climate is Changing, Food and Agriculture must too”, and the occasion will be marked in Tobago by a series of activities throughout October. “These efforts will be made to educate our stakeholders, farmers, students and the general public on agriculture,” Spencer said at the June 19 post-Executive Council media briefing. “We will conduct workshops, seminars and open days at different agricultural stations that the division has responsibility for throughout October, with [the aim of boosting] awareness [about the importance] of farming.” The division is educating the public about the benefits of agriculture as it seeks to enhance the island''s food production. Calypso Rose a ''trailblazer'' The undisputed title of calypso queen, international awards, and a Hummingbird Medal (gold) in a musical career spanning decades: Calypso Rose has it all. And in her native Tobago, the artiste, Linda McArtha Sandy Lewis, is being hailed as a “trailblazer” for women, and Tobagonians on the whole by Secretary of Community Development, Enterprise Development and Labour Marslyn Melville-Jack. On July 14, a Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft was officially commissioned to honour Calypso Rose, now 77. Melville-Jack said naming the aircraft after the veteran performer “is just like breaking the ceiling for all of Tobago, and all of the women in Tobago”. Minister of Tourism Shamfa Cudjoe said the Government will be seeking to leverage the popularity of Calypso Rose for its tourism campaign. “We are now in discussion with her management team to get on board for our overseas tourism campaign in France for the new fiscal year,” Cudjoe said. “So we''re hoping that that comes to fruition and that we can maximise all that we can from this opportunity.” BRINGING ANIMATION TO THE YOUTH Participants of the “Oceans and Technology: A Sea of Learning” Camp are getting hands-on knowledge in non-traditional areas: robot programming, digital animation and computer coding. In an interview at the camp on June 20, animation tutor Danielle Blaize said it''s about helping children see the possibilities for their future careers. “…This camp is different in that it''s bringing the animation to the kids instead of the kids having to come and then find their way to the school,” Blaize noted. “It''s bringing a little piece of that to them so they can start off their interest, their future career. Just [to] give them that opportunity.” The Oceans and Technology: A Sea of Learning Summer Camp runs until July 31 at the Cove Eco-Industrial Business Park.

The New Year brings with it new opportunities, which are worth considering as you position your portfolios to create wealth. 2014 a rollercoaster year The end of the US Federal Reserves Quantitative Easing programme, the (apparent) revival of the US economy, tumbling energy prices and geopolitical events all contributed to exciting times in financial markets. The results of all these events were heightened volatility and divergence in market performance which had not been experienced for some time. With respect to the ten largest equity markets, the US market (up 11.4 per cent) led as the best performing developed market, while China (up 49.1 per cent) and India (up 27.1 per cent) delivered exceptional Emerging Market returns. Aside from these three positive performances, the ten largest equity markets generated negative returns with Hong Kong being the only exception. Locally, the Central Banks economic growth forecast dwindled to 0.5 per cent for 2014 from the original projected 2.5 per cent, as oil prices experienced a 45.9 per cent decline. On the monetary front, low interest rates and excess liquidity prevailed throughout the year, although the Central Bank made attempts to place upward pressure on rates by hiking the Repo rate 50bps to 3.25 per cent Opportunities in 2015 The year 2015 should offer investors the opportunity to build wealth, across both the local and international markets. Globally, growth is projected by the IMF to increase from 3.3 per cent in 2014 to 3.8 per cent in 2015. Developed financial markets are likely to remain choppy in the coming year. While US economic data suggests the worlds largest economy is on the road to recovery, increases in US interest rates could generate volatility across both global equity and bond markets. Uncertainty remains as financial markets adjust to changing policies of global central banks, as well as event and political risks. For the investor, therefore, maintaining a diversified portfolio remains a prudent approach to investing. The local stock market may offer selective opportunities to generate wealth. The market overall is still relatively expensive, despite the local market index (the Trinidad & Tobago Composite Index or TTCI) retreating approximately 2.9 per cent in 2014. Falling oil prices could have a ripple-effect throughout the economy, cooling demand and impacting consumption and overall business activity. In such an environment companies might find it more challenging to maintain their current growth trajectory in sales and/or earnings. However, it is an election year so it would be surprising if government expenditure were clawed back to any significant extent. The full effect of lower oil prices would be more evident post-election. Investors may be best served by skewing their portfolio to international markets both in terms of equity and fixed income bonds. Notwithstanding this, the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in March/April may provide a good equity investment opportunity in 2015 as the government continues to develop capital markets and increase investor participation with its divestment programme. I hold to the view that fixed income opportunities in the international space, and in particular emerging markets, still provide good value on an inflation-adjusted basis. This is particularly so for local investors with a hold-to-maturity bias. Negative real rates of return continue to persist in the Trinidad and Tobago market as annual inflation levels (9 per cent as at November 2014) surpass medium term interest rates (GORTT 10-year yield at 2.7 per cent). In comparison, rates of return ranging from 4.75 per cent to 6.00 per cent in US dollars could be earned by investing in a portfolio of investment grade 5 to 7-year USD-denominated bonds. With US inflation at 1.3 per cent (as at November 2014), the investor can benefit from real positive returns. International bonds should remain a key part of an investor portfolio into 2015, given a medium term hold-to-maturity bias and access to hard currency. While our portfolio allocation would have been adjusted for 2015 going forward the key themes for the local investor have not changed. As the year 2015 unfolds, we at Bourse remain committed to providing the investment community with information and insights into the local, regional and international capital markets. The coming 12 months will likely offer many changes and developments across the investment sphere. What remains constant in 2015 and beyond is the importance of securing your financial future through informed investment decision-making. I take this opportunity to extend to you and your family best wishes for health, wealth and happiness in this New Year!

Guessed the name yet Obviously, none other than Dr Krishna Persad, our geologist extraordinaire. He has just produced another book, called Energy and Life, which is in electronic format, available only in PDF and priced at US$80. It is an overview of the entire energy sector in Trinidad and Tobago, dealing, among other areas, with the history of exploration, production, drilling, natural gas, refining, energy pricing and enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the last named being his premier pre-occupation at the moment. He also offers some thoughts on the future outlook for the sector in Trinidad and Tobago. The text is interspersed with Dr Persads drawings of flora and fauna and portraits of many of the stalwarts of the industry locally. As usual with anything Dr Persad has written, there are many new and interesting pieces of information that enhance ones knowledge of the countrys most important economic activity. Here are a few of these snippets: *Land fields have produced 1.5 billion barrels of oil since inception, Gulf of Paria fields over one billion barrels and the three main East Coast Marine Area (ECMA) fields Teak, Samaan and Poui over 1.2 billion or 3.7 billion all told. *New discoveries of crude are possible in the Southwest Peninsula area, where Persad himself holds acreage, including finds in deep horizons. *Exploration for gas will continue to be high for at least ten years and discoveries will boost total gas-focussed footage. However, unless Petrotrin increases its drilling activity significantly or it increases dramatically the pace of its offerings to other companies, the reality is that we will continue to see oil-related drilling activity in the onshore increase only marginally. (This is said despite the recent allocation of three land blocks, Ortoire, Rio Claro and St Marys, to three of the larger independents and their obligation to drill 12 exploration wells and, if discoveries are made, the certainty that they will sink scores of development wells). *We hear a great deal about shale oil being produced in abundance in the US because of hydraulic fractionation and horizontal drilling but how many know that fracking has been going on in Trinidad and Tobago since the 1950s Yes, indeed, and Persad tells us it was first pioneered locally by a company called Dominion Oil in its Icacos 1 well. Whats more, it was successful. With production increasing from around 50 b/d to over 500 b/d. The well has produced over 500,000 barrels of oil and is still producing at 25 b/d. *As for horizontal drilling, it was first applied in bpTTs Flambouyant field in 1994-1995 and, later, in the same companys Mahogany field. It has now become commonplace in the upstream in Trinidad and Tobago, Persad says. *Did you know that this country led the world in the use of 3D seismic surveying Yes, the author insists. The first 3D in the world ever conducted was done by Texaco in the Southeast Coast Consortium (SECC) block. *Trinidad and Tobago has shale oil potential, though, unlike the US, we have not begun to exploit it. It resides in the Upper Cretaceous Naparima Hill and Gautier formation in the onshore Southern Basin and Persad expresses the hope that in due course, the newly-developed fracking techniques will allow us to develop our considerable, easily reachable formations in the onshore Southern Basin. *While petrochemical companies and LNG exporter Atlantic are complaining about the shortage of gas for their operations, several gas fields remain undeveloped in the ECMA, Persad insists. The largest of these, he points out, are the three fields straddling the boundary line between Trinidad and Venezuela, which together contain ten tcf of gas and three fuels operated by BGTT in block 5c, which reportedly contain another 3 tcf of gas. Not to mention Centricas inability so far to develop block 22. *Trinidad and Tobago produced a wide range of oil-based petrochemicals before it switched to gas. (Bet you didnt know that). These included normal paraffins, toluene, cyclohexane, benzene, xylene, tetramer, nonene and napthenic acids. But, for various reasons, all such production had ceased by 1989. Energy and Life makes a number of predictions for the future, as you would expect such an imaginative mind like Persads to do. These include: 1. Discoveries will be made in the deep water. 2. Up to 500 million barrels of recoverable oil will be found in the three new land blocks mentioned above. 3. More oil will be found in the ECMA once deep drilling below the gas/condensate legs takes place. He also urges the powers-that-be to get the state owned Petrotrin out of refinery operations completely or at least sell a majority interest to a well-qualified international partner and to decrease the subsidy on diesel by 50 per cent immediately and remove it completely within 12 months. As for his new obsession with CO2 as the ideal oil recovery injection mechanism, Persad points out (and not for the first time): CO2/EOR can kill two birds with one stone dramatically improve oil recovery percentages in known oilfields and, in the process, the vast majority of our CO2 emissions can be captured and sequestered.

However, the term is much broader in scope and these garbage items, although arguably the most visible, belong to just one of several categories of marine pollutants. The United Nations in its 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea describes marine pollution as “the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the marine environment, including estuaries, which results or is likely to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine life; hazards to human health; hindrance to marine activities, including fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea; and impairment of quality for use of sea water and reduction of amenities”. This definitely encompasses more than just litter! What other pollutants exist in the marine environment Major categories include (1) pathogens i.e. organisms which cause illness or disease; these are present, for example, in untreated sewage (2) bio-degradable organics e.g. sewage (3) nutrients—compounds containing nitrogen (e.g. fertilisers) or phosphorus (e.g. household detergents) (4) heavy metals e.g. cadmium, lead and mercury (5) hydrocarbons (oils) (6) persistent organic pollutants (''POPs'')- these can be produced intentionally e.g. some pesticides, or unintentionally (''uPOPs'') due to incomplete combustion during open burning and industrial activity (7) sediments, and last, (but not least!) (8) litter. Opposition Leader Kamla Persad-Bissessar celebrates her 67th birthday today.

At what would have been a special news conference on Carnival Sunday, Dr Rowley told the country of an appointment with his medical team in Los Angeles, California. He leaves today for what he said was “further examination of a build-up of plaque” in one of the arteries to his heart. He disclosed that he had neglected to have his annual medical check-up done last year, as a result of which his local physician has advised on the current course of action. He provided details about having had examinations conducted in 2016 and 2017, including a prostate examination in 2016, for which he was “cleared”. It was then, he said, he had opted to have a coronary examination done because he said the service was available. It was discovered then that there was this build-up of plaque in one of his coronary arteries. He said this was checked during his medical update in 2017 and he was advised to have annual checks but that, because of his work schedule in 2018, a year and a half have elapsed since this last examination. He would have been heading out of the country today, in any case, for a meeting as part of a Caricom team with the American Secretary of State on the on-going crisis in neighbouring Venezuela. That meeting has been called off, however, and Dr Rowley has opted to use the moment to honour his commitment to have this medical check-up conducted. We wish the Prime Minister well, and hope that the matter is one that does not warrant radical procedures that may require convalescence of a sort that may keep him off the job for longer than he might expect. But once again, this issue re-opens questions about the quality of health care available in Trinidad and Tobago, such that persons who can afford will have options that are not available to the vast majority of the population. And when this matter involves persons in public life the issue is bound to generate discussion about how come our health services are not good enough. Of course, there are success stories which find their way into the public space about work being conducted by our medical professionals, in one sphere of activity or the other, with testimonials from patients and their relatives. Still, on another front, the Prime Minister’s disclosure that he had missed an important appointment for such a crucial health check is a potent reminder to all of us about not neglecting to pay attention to our health needs. As Dr Rowley himself indicated, his schedule as Prime Minister is a punishing one, and this can often get in the way of taking care of one’s personal needs. But this is as good a reminder as any to the rest of us, not to unduly delay paying attention to those matters regarding our own critical health needs. IT has taken a long time for the Government to begin to acknowledge what was evident from the beginning about the Dragon gas deal. MANY aspects of this society proceed on the momentum of the past. Memory is stored in the civil service, or the teaching service. These do not change when governments change so past practices endure. AMID the murder and mayhem, an even darker threat emerged in Trinidad and Tobago during Holy Week. Last Wednesday, with suspicious sloppiness, the Telecommuni­cations Authority of Tri­nidad and Tobago (TATT) wrote to Central Broadcasting Services (CBS), parent company of Radio and TV Jaagriti, of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, led by secretary general Sat Maharaj, warning of a breach of its broadcast code. AN entire Lent passed the calypso season, and the leggo licence exploited by Cro Cro, at the steering wheel, when not at the microphone. AN innocent man died. He was murdered because He was framed and the system of justice failed Him. Whether you are Christian and celebrating the resurrection of Christ on Easter Sunday or if you simply believe that He was a prophet or historical holy man, His death illustrates how a system of justice can fail to protect the innocent. The race dilemma facing our country is very sad and concerning at the same time. What have we become as a country where race appears to be a weapon we continue to use to degrade others? We are completely divided by race when coming to politics. Want to share good news story, or do you have information that should see the light of day? Then we want to hear from you. Instagram ', 1),

Bartholomew was speaking at a press conference held Monday at the MRF''s offices at Queen''s Park East, Port of Spain. He said it was a disgrace that the Foundation could not even afford to attend and present research papers at annual international HIV conferences abroad, because of a lack of funding. MRF financial resource manager Natasha Singh revealed that the Foundation currently owes in excess of $117,000 in rent and more than half a million dollars to various creditors. Bartholomew said for the past several years, the MRF has submitted yearly audited financial reports to the Ministry of Health, justifying the need for certain sums of money, without success. To add insult to injury, he said, Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Colin Furlonge requested in a letter dated March 18 to the HIV/AIDS Co-ordinating Unit that the MRF and all other treatment centres provide a detailed report for the last ten years of HIV services provided including the number of new and repeat patients on a monthly basis. Bartholomew said this would be an exhausting procedure as the MRF is being asked to submit invoices for every single thing, including tissue paper. He said this move would further delay the disbursement of funds. Bartholomew said the lack of funds was affecting the delivery of services to patients as well as research efforts. Other issues raised by MRF staff was a shortage of essential HIV/AIDS drugs and CD4 kits as well as equipment that was more than a decade old. As a result of the shortage, patients have been switched to other drugs said Ingrid Marcelline, MRF chief pharmacist. And while patients would normally receive a three-month supply of medication, now they can only get a two-week supply, she said. Marcelline said the medication must be taken every day or the patient runs the risk of becoming resistant to the treatment. The shortage, she said, was putting lives at risk. When contacted by the Express, Health Minister Dr Fuad Khan assured that funding would be provided soon. ?Cabinet has passed a note, it is just a matter for the Ministry of Finance to organise it, he said.

ArcelorMittal workers who lost their jobs in Trinidad in 2016. The International Labour Organization (ILO) is predicting that unemployment in Latin America and the Caribbean will rise to 8.4 per cent this year. The ILO has released its World Employment Social Outlook, indicating that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. “In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent from 5.7 per cent in 2016, representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017.” It said that the increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017. “In fact, the number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016.” The ILO said that of notable concern are developments in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.3 percentage points in 2017, to reach 8.4 per cent. The ILO report notes that in several Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, the percentage of those who are looking for work but unable to finds jobs in 2017 will range from four to six per cent in Trinidad and Tobago to above 17 per cent in islands like St Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The ILO report notes that in Caribbean countries like Guyana, Haiti, Barbados and Suriname, the percentage of people looking for work is between nine to 13 per cent, while in the Bahamas the figure is between 13-17 per cent. The report also notes that discontent with the social situation and lack of decent job opportunities are both factors that play a role in a person''s decision to migrate. “In fact, between 2009 and 2016, the share of the working-age population willing to migrate abroad permanently increased in every region of the world except for Southern Asia and South-Eastern Asia and the Pacific. “The largest increases over this period took place in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Arab States. Overall, the share of people willing to move abroad remained the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, at 32 per cent, followed closely by Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern Africa, at above 30 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively,” the ILO report added.

Cabinet appointed Industrial Court judge Nizam Khan “I NEVER heard a thing. I have been good...” This is the response of newly Cabinet appointed Industrial Court judge Nizam Khan when contacted for comment on sexual harassment claims against him. Last Wednesday Khan, who currently presides at the Port of Spain Magistrates Court, was asked to comment on allegations that he had made inappropriate sexual advances toward women. The Magistrate said he was not surprised such “things” were being bandied about. “Since I got this appointment there are all kinds of things coming up. “Since it came out that my name is an appointee, I am hearing all kinds of things. I can only say there are people who have ill motives, because they have ulterior motives, it is not a good one. I find it strange a lot of things are circulating, not this one (sexual harassment and intoxication). Whoever the detractors are, they are out to sabotage me, to trample down on my good career and spotless one. I never heard a thing. I have been good and because I have the highest professionalism about me, people are upset. I had a very good career at the Director of Public Prosecutions Office, as a Magistrate and at the Industrial Court. “My last year at the Port of Spain Magistrates’ Court was a great one. If you speak with the public and employees at the Tunapuna Magistrates’ Court they will tell you I go the extra mile...” He said when news of his appointment broke, “strange enough it was mentioned in Parliament, when the Opposition questioned the appointment and Government responded saying the best people were selected. “I am a clean man who has balance and neutrality. I never had problems with the unions and I never had any bad appeals. I am now a target,” Khan said. Khan, who served at the Industrial Court from May 1, 2012 to April 30, 2017, was again appointed by Cabinet two weeks ago. Sources told the Sunday Express that the announcement, which was made by Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi on April 8 at a media briefing, left at least two women court employees and a janitor uneasy, since verbal claims had been lodged at the Industrial Court that he sexually harassed them while intoxicated at court functions. One of the allegations is dated December 2012 and involved a woman court employee at a Christmas function held in Chaguanas. The alleged victims are said to have reported the incidents to senior court officials at the Industrial Court and Khan was cautioned. Contacted by the Sunday Express on April 13, Assistant Registrar of the Industrial Court Kathy-Ann Alexander-Fraser said she had “no comment” on the allegations. Several efforts to contact president of the Industrial Court Deborah Thomas-Felix via her cell phone, through WhatsApp, texts and calls were unsuccessful. Contacted on April 9 by the Sunday Express and asked about the mechanisms in place to select the judges, Al-Rawi said several factors are taken into consideration when choosing. He denied knowing about the allegations against Khan, saying: “No. I am not aware at all. This is the first I am hearing of this. What I am hearing is news to me.” The Sunday Express asked specifically whether he was aware of the reports lodged at the Industrial Court but Al-Rawi said: “No, nor do I easily accept what is being said, since this country is filled with so much rumour and speculation.” Khan had served as an Industrial Court Judge for five years and returned to the Magistracy. He will now have to seek another three years of no pay leave to take up the Industrial Court appointment. However, the decision rests with his boss Chief Justice Ivor Archie on whether he will be granted an additional three years no pay leave. Sources told the Sunday Express should the CJ grant this additional leave then a precedent will be set allowing other magistrates’ and judges to apply for additional no pay leave to pursue other employment opportunities beyond five years.
